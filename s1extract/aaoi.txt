PROSPECTUS SUMMARY 

        This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that
you should consider in making your investment decision. Before investing in our common stock, you should carefully read this
entire prospectus, including our consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the related notes thereto and the information set forth

Overview

        We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of ﬁber-optic networking products, primarily for three networking end-
markets: cable television, or CATV, ﬁber-to-the-home, or FTTH, and internet data center. We design and manufacture a range of
optical communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete
turn-key equipment. In designing products for our customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser
components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers'
needs and speciﬁcations, and such products differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We
are primarily focused on the higher-performance segments within all three of our target markets, which increasingly demand
faster connectivity and innovation.

        The three end markets we target are all driven by signiﬁcant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected
devices, video trafﬁc, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, CATV and
telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data
services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability and capability of their networks. The trend of rising
bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reﬂected in the shift to higher speed server connections.
As a result of these trends, ﬁber-optic networking technology is becoming essential in all three of our target markets, as it is often
the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth.

        The CATV market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including
lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. In 2012, we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest
provider of subsystems to the CATV industry, according to research ﬁrm Ovum Limited, or Ovum. Sales of headend, node and
distribution equipment have contributed signiﬁcantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of
CATV equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While equipment
vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products, within the past four years certain of our customers
have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third
parties. The shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our
extensive high-speed optical, mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to beneﬁt
from these industry dynamics.

        Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast
response times to customer requests and control over product quality and manufacturing costs. We design, manufacture and
integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy, or MBE, fabrication process, which we
believe is unique in our industry. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical

1

 
Table of Contents

components that are used in our products. The lasers we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of
changes in temperature and humidity, making them well-suited to the CATV and FTTH markets where networking equipment is
often installed outdoors.

        In 2013, our revenue was $78.4 million and our gross margin was 29.4%. We have grown our annual revenue at a CAGR of
33.1% between 2009 and 2013. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, we incurred losses of $5.3 million,
$0.9 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, and our accumulated deﬁcit at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 was
$81.9 million and $83.3 million, respectively. In 2013, we earned 60.4% of our total revenue from the CATV market, and 24.7%
of our total revenue from the data center market. In 2013, our key customers in the CATV market included Cisco Systems and
Biogenomics Corp., a distributor. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Cisco Systems accounted for 26.8%, 33.2%, and 21.8%, respectively,
of our revenue and Biogenomics Corp. accounted for 11.7%, 11.2% and 8.7%, respectively, of our revenue. In 2013, our key
customers in the data center market included Amazon and Microsoft. In 2012 and 2013, Amazon accounted for 5.8% and 18.2%
of our revenue, respectively, and Microsoft accounted for 2.6% and 6.1% of our revenue, respectively.

Industry Background

        Our three target markets of CATV, FTTH and internet data centers share a common trend of a signiﬁcant growth in
bandwidth consumption, and the corresponding need for network infrastructure improvement to support it.

        The prevailing themes in our target markets include:

•

•

•

Trends in the CATV Market.  In recent years, CATV service providers have invested extensively to support high
speed, two-way communications, and we expect that they will continue to do so, particularly in countries with less
developed CATV networks, such as China. 

While equipment vendors have historically only relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products,
within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and
manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties. The shift is due in part to the
sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. 

Trends in the FTTH Market.  The FTTH market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that
telecommunications service providers are deploying. The most commonly deployed PON technology is Gigabit
PON, or GPON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data, but due to the splitting of the bandwidth
among multiple users, the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than 2.5 gigabits per
second. One approach that does support true 1 gigabit per second service to the home is wavelength division
multiplexing PON, or WDM-PON, a technology that enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data
over a single ﬁber-optic strand. 

Trends in the Internet Data Center Market.  To support the substantial increase in bandwidth consumption,
internet data center operators are increasing the scale of their internet data centers and accelerating data
transmission rates. As a result, there is an ongoing transition from the use of copper cable, typically at speeds up
to 1 gigabit, to optical ﬁber as a transport medium, typically providing speeds from 10 gigabit to 40 gigabit. In
recent years, a number of leading Internet companies have begun to adopt more open internet data center
architectures, using a mix of systems and components

from a variety of vendors, and in some cases designing their own equipment. For these companies, compatibility
of new networking equipment with legacy infrastructure is not as important, and as a consequence, these
companies are more willing to work with non-traditional equipment vendors, which creates an open and growing
opportunity for optical device vendors.

        We experience certain challenges within our target markets, including continuous pressure to innovate and deliver highly
integrated products that perform reliably in harsh, demanding environments and to produce high-quality devices in large
volumes.

Our Solutions

        By addressing the challenges in our target markets, we provide the following beneﬁts to our customers:

•

•

•

•

Enable customers to deliver innovative products.  We leverage our deep expertise in high-speed optical, mixed-
signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering and our proprietary MBE laser fabrication process to deliver
technologically advanced products to our customers. 

Enhance efﬁciency and cost effectiveness of our customers' supply chain.  We design and sell products at the
level of integration desired by a customer, from components to turn-key equipment, providing our customers a
dependable, cost-effective and simpliﬁed supply chain. 

Deliver high quality, reliable products in high volume.  As a vertically integrated supplier, we are able to monitor
and maintain quality control throughout the production process, using our internally produced components where
possible for our ﬁnal products. With manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Taiwan and China, we can support high
volume production and timely delivery for our customers around the world. 

Provide sophisticated design solutions to our customers.  We believe our in-house expertise in both analog and
digital optical engineering enables us to design comprehensive solutions that meet many of the different network
architectures and protocols used by our customers.

Our Strengths

        Our key competitive strengths include the following:

•

•

•

Industry-leading position in the CATV market.  We are the leading provider of optical components and the
second largest provider of subsystems to the CATV market, according to Ovum. 

Proprietary technological expertise and track record of innovation.  We continue to develop innovative products
by leveraging our technological expertise, including our proprietary MBE laser fabrication process. 

Highly customized products.  Most of our products have some level of customization, making it more difﬁcult for
our customers to switch rapidly to another supplier. We believe this element of customization contributes to longer
product lifecycles and more stable product pricing.

3

Table of Contents

•

•

Proven system design capabilities.  We have deep expertise and proven design capabilities in high-speed optical,
mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering, which we believe position us to take advantage of the
continuing shift to outsourced design and manufacturing among CATV equipment vendors. 

Vertically integrated, geographically distributed manufacturing model.  Our vertically integrated design and
manufacturing process encompasses various steps from laser design and fabrication to complete optical system
design and assembly. Furthermore, we have geographically distributed our manufacturing by strategically locating
our operations in the U.S., China and Taiwan to reduce development time and production costs, to better support
our customers and to help protect our intellectual property.

Our Strategy

        We seek to be the leading global provider of optical components, modules and equipment for each of our three target
markets, CATV, FTTH and internet data centers. Our strategy includes the following key elements:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Extend our leadership in CATV networking.  We intend to maintain our position as the leading producer of
optical components used in CATV networks, and to capture an increasing share of the CATV equipment market as
the major equipment vendors continue to outsource the design and manufacturing of such products. 

Continue to penetrate the FTTH market.  We believe our WDM-PON technology is a cost-effective solution for
delivering 1 gigabit bandwidth to a home. Our goal is to capture an increasing share of the FTTH market by
delivering 1G asynchronous service to the home through internet service provider customers. 

Continue to penetrate the internet data center market.  In the internet data center, we target internet data center
operators who have adopted an open system architecture—one in which the optical connectivity solutions can be
provided by a different vendor than the vendor which provides their servers and switches. 

Continue to invest in our capabilities and infrastructure.  We intend to continue to invest in new products, new
technology and our production infrastructure and facilities to maintain and strengthen our competitive position. 

Selectively pursue other opportunities that leverage our existing expertise.  Our expertise in designing and
manufacturing outdoor equipment for the CATV industry positions us well to pursue applications that are also
characterized by having varying and demanding environments, including wireless and wireline telecom
infrastructure, industrial robotics, aerospace and defense, and oil and gas exploration. 

Pursue complementary acquisition and strategic alliance opportunities.  We evaluate and selectively pursue
acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances that we believe will enhance or complement our current product
offerings, augment our technology roadmap, or diversify our revenue base.

Risk Factors

        Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, such as those highlighted in the "Risk Factors" section
immediately following this prospectus summary, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

We are dependent on our key customers for a signiﬁcant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a signiﬁcant
reduction in orders from, any of our key customers would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations; 

If our customers do not qualify our products for use on a timely basis, our results of operations may suffer; 

Customer demand is difﬁcult to forecast accurately and, as a result, we may be unable to match production with
customer demand; 

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in which we compete and any future downturn will likely
reduce demand for our products and revenue; 

If the CATV, FTTH and internet data center markets do not continue to develop as we expect, or if there is any
downturn in these markets, our business would be materially adversely affected; 

If we encounter manufacturing problems, we may lose sales and damage our customer relationships; 

We must continually develop successful new products and enhance existing products, and if we fail to do so or if
our release of new or enhanced products is delayed, our business may be harmed; 

Given the high ﬁxed costs associated with our vertically integrated business, a reduction in demand for our
products could materially adversely impact our gross proﬁts and our results of operations; 

We face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share; and 

We have substantial manufacturing assets in Asia, and in 2013 we derived approximately 27.4% of our revenue
from sales in Asia.

These expenses include share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense is accounted for at fair value, using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the stock options and was
included in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as follows:

We prepare Adjusted EBITDA and our other non-GAAP measures to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our
overall operating performance. To arrive at our non-GAAP gross proﬁt, we exclude share-based compensation expense from our GAAP gross
proﬁt. To arrive at our non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, we exclude all amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation
expense and non-recurring consulting fees, if any, from our GAAP net income (loss) from operations. To arrive at Adjusted EBITDA, we
exclude these same items and, additionally, exclude asset impairment charges, loss (gain) from disposal of idle assets, unrealized exchange
loss (gain), interest (income) expense, on a net basis, provision for (beneﬁt from) income taxes and depreciation expense, from our GAAP net
income (loss).

        We believe that our non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following
reasons:

•

•

•

•

We believe that elimination of items such as share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization,
income tax expense and other income, net, is appropriate because treatment of these items may vary for reasons
unrelated to our overall operating performance; 

We use non-GAAP measures in conjunction with our GAAP ﬁnancial measures for planning purposes, including
the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of
our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our ﬁnancial performance; 

We believe that non-GAAP measures provide better comparability with our past ﬁnancial performance, facilitates
better period-to-period comparisons of operational results and also facilitates comparisons with our peer
companies, many of which also use similar non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting;
and 

We anticipate that, after consummating this offering, our investor presentations and those of securities analyst will
include non-GAAP measures to evaluate our overall operating performance.

        Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross proﬁt, income (loss)
from operations, net income (loss) or any other measure of ﬁnancial performance calculated and presented in accordance with
GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
organizations because other organizations may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or such other non-GAAP measures in the same
manner. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason we consider them appropriate.

RISK FACTORS 

        Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
all other information contained in this prospectus before purchasing our common stock. If any of the following risks actually
occur, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations could
be seriously harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks,
and you may lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Inherent in Our Business

We are dependent on our key customers for a signiﬁcant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a signiﬁcant reduction in
orders from, any of our key customers would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.

        We generate much of our revenue from a limited number of customers. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our top ten customers
represented 76.6%, 77.6%, and 76.9% of our revenue, respectively. In 2013, Cisco Systems, Inc. represented 21.8% of our
revenue, Amazon represented 18.2% of our revenue and Biogenomics Corp., a distributor, represented 8.7% of our total revenue.
As a result, the loss of, or a signiﬁcant reduction in orders from any of our key customers would materially and adversely affect
our revenue and results of operations. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our customers and instead rely on
recurring purchase orders. If our key customers do not continue to purchase our existing products or fail to purchase additional
products from us, our revenue would decline and our results of operations would be adversely affected.

        Adverse events affecting our key customers could also negatively affect our ability to retain their business and obtain new
purchase orders, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. For example, in recent years, there has been
consolidation among various network equipment manufacturers and this trend is expected to continue. We are unable to predict
the impact that industry consolidation would have on our existing or potential customers. We may not be able to offset any
potential decline in revenue arising from the consolidation of our existing customers with revenue from new customers or
additional revenue from the merged company.

If our customers do not qualify our products for use on a timely basis, our results of operations may suffer.

        Prior to the sale of new products, our customers typically require us to obtain their approval and qualify our products for use
in their applications. Additionally, new customers often audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other evaluations during
this process. The qualiﬁcation process involves product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product
management and engineering teams in the design and manufacturing stages. If we are unable to accurately predict the amount of
time required to qualify our products with customers, or are unable to qualify our products with certain customers at all, then our
ability to generate revenue could be delayed or our revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the
costs associated with the qualiﬁcation process or with our product development efforts, which would have an adverse effect on
our results of operations.

        In addition, due to rapid technological changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we
have qualiﬁed our product or begun volume manufacturing of a qualiﬁed product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover
the expenses for cancelled or

11

Table of Contents

unutilized custom design projects. It is difﬁcult to predict with any certainty whether our customers will delay or terminate
product qualiﬁcation or the frequency with which customers will cancel or modify their projects, but any such delay, cancellation
or modiﬁcation would have a negative effect on our results of operations.

        Our ability to successfully qualify and scale capacity for new technologies and products is important to our ability to grow
our business and market presence. If we are unable to qualify and sell any of our new products in volume, on time, or at all, our
results of operations may be adversely affected.

Customer demand is difﬁcult to forecast accurately and, as a result, we may be unable to match production with customer
demand.

        We make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept,
production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our
estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase
orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to buy
any quantity of products beyond ﬁrm purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or
delay purchase orders already in place without signiﬁcant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and
the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer
requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our
manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce
our gross margin. We may not have sufﬁcient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, or one or
more of our suppliers may not have sufﬁcient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. If any of our major
customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, we will likely have excess manufacturing capacity or
inventory and our business and results of operations would be harmed.

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in which we compete and any future downturn will likely reduce demand
for our products and revenue.

        In each of our target markets, including the CATV market, our sales depend on the aggregate capital expenditures of service
providers as they build out and upgrade their network infrastructure. These markets are highly cyclical and characterized by
constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving standards and wide ﬂuctuations in product supply and demand.
In the past, these markets have experienced signiﬁcant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of
product cycles. These downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high
inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Our historical results of operations have been subject to these
cyclical ﬂuctuations, and we may experience substantial period-to-period ﬂuctuations in our future results of operations. Any
future downturn in any of the markets in which we compete could signiﬁcantly reduce the demand for our products and therefore
may result in a signiﬁcant reduction in our revenue. Our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely
affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical changes in any of the markets utilizing our
products. We may not be able to accurately predict these cyclical ﬂuctuations and the impact of these ﬂuctuations may have on
our revenue and operating results.

12

Table of Contents

If the CATV market does not continue to develop as we expect, or if there is any downturn in this market, our business would
be adversely affected.

        Historically, we have generated much of our revenue from the CATV market. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 the CATV market
represented 81.4%, 78.6% and 60.4% of our revenue, respectively. In the CATV market, we are relying on expected increasing
demand for bandwidth-intensive services and applications such as on-demand television programs, high-deﬁnition television
channels, or HDTV, social media, peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing and online video creation and viewing from network service providers.
Without network and bandwidth growth, the need for our products will not increase and may decline, adversely affecting our
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. Although demand for broadband access is increasing, network and bandwidth
growth may be limited by several factors, including an uncertain regulatory environment, high infrastructure costs to purchase
and install equipment and uncertainty as to which competing content delivery solution, such as telecommunications, wireless or
satellite, will gain the most widespread acceptance. CATV network operators may reduce or forego equipment purchases in
anticipation of the availability of next generation DOCSIS3.1 solutions that are expected to be available soon, which may
adversely affect our sales. If the trend of outsourcing for the design and manufacture of CATV equipment does not continue, or
continues at a slower pace than currently expected, our customers' demand for our design and manufacturing services may not
grow as quickly as expected. If expectations for the growth of the CATV market are not realized, our ﬁnancial condition or results
of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, if the CATV market is adversely impacted, whether due to competitive
pressure from telecommunication service providers, regulatory changes, or otherwise, our business would be adversely affected.
In February 2014, Time Warner and Comcast, the two largest CATV providers in the U.S., announced that they had agreed to
merge. We are unable to predict what impact this transaction, if completed, would have on the CATV market or on our business.
We may not be able to offset any potential decline in revenue from the CATV market with revenue from new customers in other
markets.

We have limited operating history in the FTTH and internet data center markets, and our business could be harmed if these
markets do not develop as we expect.

        We have only recently begun offering products to the FTTH and internet data center markets. Our business in these markets
is dependent on the deployment of our optical components, modules and subassemblies. In the FTTH market, we are relying on
increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and telecommunications service providers' acceptance and deployment of
WDM-PON as a technology supporting 1 gigabit per second service to the home. In the internet data center market, we are
relying on the emergence of new internet data center providers and their adoption of open internet data center architectures that
use a mix of systems and components from a variety of vendors, including non-traditional equipment vendors. Without network
and bandwidth growth and adoption of our solutions by operators in these markets, we will not be able to sell our products in
these markets in high volume or at our targeted margins, which would adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of
operations. For example, WDM-PON technology may not be adopted by equipment and service providers in the FTTH market as
rapidly as we expect or in the volumes we need to achieve acceptable margins, and internet data centers may elect to use larger
vendors that require internet data center operators to purchase the optical modules for their systems from such larger vendors.
Also, internet data centers may not expand as much or as quickly as expected and any slow-down in expansion could adversely
impact our business and growth prospects. Network and bandwidth growth may be limited by several factors, including an
uncertain regulatory environment, high infrastructure costs to purchase and install equipment and uncertainty as to which
competing content delivery solution, such as CATV, will gain the most widespread

13

Table of Contents

acceptance. In addition, as we enter new markets or expand our product offerings in existing markets, our margins may be
adversely affected due to competition in those markets and commoditization of competing products. If our expectations for the
growth of these markets are not realized, our ﬁnancial condition or results of operations will be adversely affected.

If we encounter manufacturing problems, we may lose sales and damage our customer relationships.

        We may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations. These and other factors
may cause less than acceptable yields at our wafer fabrication facility. Manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors,
including the quality of available raw materials, the degradation or change in equipment calibration and the rate and timing of the
introduction of new products. Changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product speciﬁcations,
changing customer needs and the introduction of new product lines may signiﬁcantly reduce our manufacturing yields, resulting
in low or negative margins on those products. In addition, we use an MBE fabrication process to make our lasers, rather than
Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition, or MOCVD, the technique most commonly used in optical manufacturing by
communications optics vendors, and our MBE fabrication process relies on custom-manufactured equipment. If our MBE
fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas were to be damaged or destroyed for any reason, our manufacturing process would be
severely disrupted. Any such manufacturing problems would likely delay product shipments to our customers, which would
negatively affect our sales, competitive position and reputation. We may also experience delays in production, typically in
February, during the Chinese New Year holiday when our facilities in China and Taiwan are closed.

We must continually develop successful new products and enhance existing products, and if we fail to do so or if our release
of new or enhanced products is delayed, our business may be harmed.

        The markets for our products are characterized by frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements
and evolving industry standards, all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost and meet stringent reliability and qualiﬁcation
requirements. Our future performance will depend on our successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new
and enhanced products that address these challenges. If we are unable to make our new or enhanced products commercially
available on a timely basis, we may lose existing and potential customers and our ﬁnancial results would suffer.

        In addition, due to the costs and length of research, development and manufacturing process cycles, we may not recognize
revenue from new products until long after such expenditures, if at all, and our margins may decrease if our costs are higher than
expected, adversely affecting our ﬁnancial condition and results of operation.

        Although the length of our product development cycle varies widely by product and customer, it may take 18 months or
longer before we receive our ﬁrst order. As a result, we may incur signiﬁcant expenses long before customers accept and
purchase our products.

        Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including:

•

•

modiﬁcation of product speciﬁcations and customer requirements; 

unanticipated engineering complexities;

14

Table of Contents

•

•

difﬁculties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; and 

rapidly changing technology or competitive product requirements.

        The introduction of new products by us or our competitors could result in a slowdown in demand for our existing products
and could result in a write-down in the value of our inventory. We have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for
existing products and delays in new product development, and such delays will likely occur in the future. To the extent we
experience product development delays for any reason or we fail to qualify our products and obtain their approval for use, which
we refer to as a design win, our competitive position would be adversely affected and our ability to grow our revenue would be
impaired.

        Furthermore, our ability to enter a market with new products in a timely manner can be critical to our success because it is
difﬁcult to displace an existing supplier for a particular type of product once a customer has chosen a supplier, even if a later-to-
market product provides better performance or cost efﬁciency.

        The development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring frequent
innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel and signiﬁcant capital, as well as the accurate anticipation of
technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support
new or enhanced products successfully or on a timely basis. Further, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market
acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product introductions by competitors, technological changes or
emerging industry standards. We also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new
products and enhancements, license these technologies from third parties, or remain competitive in our markets.

Increasing costs and shifts in product mix may adversely impact our gross margins.

        Our gross margins on individual products and among products ﬂuctuate over each product's life cycle. Our overall gross
margins have ﬂuctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in
average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs, and these ﬂuctuations are expected to continue in the future. We
may not be able to accurately predict our product mix from period to period, and as a result we may not be able to forecast
accurately our overall gross margins. The rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our
revenue, either of which would materially and adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our ﬁnancial condition.

Given the high ﬁxed costs associated with our vertically integrated business, a reduction in demand for our products will
likely adversely impact our gross proﬁts and our results of operations.

        We have a high ﬁxed cost base due to our vertically integrated business model, including the fact that 938 of our employees
as of December 31, 2013 were employed in manufacturing and research and development operations. We may not be able to
adjust these ﬁxed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross proﬁt and gross margin are greatly
affected by our sales volume and volatility on a quarterly basis and the corresponding absorption of ﬁxed manufacturing
overhead expenses. In addition, because we are a vertically integrated manufacturer, insufﬁcient demand for our products may
subject us to the risk of high inventory carrying costs and increased inventory obsolescence. Given our vertical integration, the
rate at

15

Table of Contents

which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change
signiﬁcantly in the future and believe that we will have to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of
sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a signiﬁcant amount of working capital invested in inventory. We may be
required to write down inventory costs in the future and our high inventory costs may have an adverse effect on our gross proﬁts
and our results of operations.

We have a history of losses which may continue in the future.

        We have a history of losses and we may incur additional losses in future periods. In the years ended December 31, 2011,
2012 and 2013, we experienced net losses of $5.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012
and December 31, 2013, our accumulated deﬁcit was $81.9 million and $83.3 million, respectively. These losses were due to
expenditures made to expand our business, including expenditures for hiring additional research and development and sales and
marketing personnel, and expenditures to expand and maintain our manufacturing facilities and research and development
operations. We expect to continue to make signiﬁcant expenditures related to our business, including expenditures for hiring
additional research and development and sales and marketing personnel, and expenditures to maintain and expand our
manufacturing facilities and research and development operations. In addition, we have incurred signiﬁcant additional time
demands and legal, accounting and other expenses since we became a public company in September 2013. Our management and
other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to complying with the applicable rules and requirements of being a public
company.

Our ﬁnancial results may vary signiﬁcantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in
our stock price.

        Our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary signiﬁcantly from quarter
to quarter. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly
ﬂuctuations. These ﬂuctuations are due to numerous factors, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

the timing, size and mix of sales of our products; 

ﬂuctuations in demand for our products, including the increase, decrease, rescheduling or cancellation of
signiﬁcant customer orders; 

our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner and
that meet customer requirements; 

new product introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors; 

the gain or loss of key customers; 

the rate at which our present and potential customers and end users adopt our technologies; 

changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors; 

quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations; 

length and variability of the sales cycles of our products;

16

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

unanticipated increases in costs or expenses; 

the loss of key employees; 

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our customers, affecting the timing of their spending for our
products; 

political stability in the areas of the world in which we operate; 

ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 

changes in accounting rules; 

the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our solutions; and 

general economic conditions and changes in such conditions speciﬁc to our target markets.

        The foregoing factors are difﬁcult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our
quarterly and annual operating results. In addition, a signiﬁcant amount of our operating expenses is relatively ﬁxed in nature due
to our internal manufacturing, research and development, sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending
quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results
of operations. For these reasons, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator
of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research
analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease signiﬁcantly. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to successfully address these risks.

We face intense competition which could negatively impact our results of operations and market share.

        The markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international
companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in niche markets. Current and potential
competitors may have substantially greater name recognition, ﬁnancial, marketing, research and manufacturing resources than we
do, and there can be no assurance that our current and future competitors will not be more successful than us in speciﬁc product
lines or markets. Certain of our competitors may also have better-established relationships with our current or potential
customers. Some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire new products and technologies and create market
awareness for their products and technologies. In addition, some of our competitors have the ﬁnancial resources to offer
competitive products at below-market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively and result in a loss of sales
or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products. In recent years, there has been consolidation in our industry and we
expect such consolidation to continue. Consolidation involving our competitors could result in even more intense competition.
Network equipment manufacturers, who are our customers, and network service providers may decide to manufacture the optical
subsystems incorporated into their network systems in-house instead of outsourcing such products to companies such as us. We
also encounter potential customers that, because of existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the products
offered by our competitors.

We depend on key personnel to develop and maintain our technology and manage our business in a rapidly changing market.

        The continued services of our executive ofﬁcers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support
personnel is essential to our success. For example, our ability to achieve new design wins depends upon the experience and
expertise of our engineers. Any of our key employees, including our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Chief
Strategy Ofﬁcer, Senior Vice President of Network Equipment Module Business Unit and Asia General Manager, may resign at
any time. We do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees. To implement our business plan, we
also intend to hire additional employees, particularly in the areas of engineering and manufacturing. Our ability to continue to
attract and retain highly skilled employees is a critical factor in our success. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense.
We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualiﬁed personnel to satisfy our current or future needs. Our
ability to develop, manufacture and sell our products, and thus our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations, would be
adversely affected if we are unable to retain existing personnel or hire additional qualiﬁed personnel.

We depend on a limited number of suppliers and any supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business.

        We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in our products. Some of these
suppliers could disrupt our business if they stop, decrease or delay shipments or if the materials or components they ship have
quality or reliability issues. Some of the raw materials and components we use in our products are available only from a sole
source or have been qualiﬁed only from a single supplier. Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a limited
number of entities from whom we could obtain certain materials and components. We may also face shortages if we experience
increased demand for materials or components beyond what our qualiﬁed suppliers can deliver. Our inability to obtain sufﬁcient
quantities of critical materials or components could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products, adversely
affecting our ﬁnancial condition and results of operation.

        We typically have not entered into long-term agreements with our suppliers and, therefore, our suppliers could stop
supplying materials and components to us at any time or fail to supply adequate quantities of materials or components to us on a
timely basis. It is difﬁcult, costly, time consuming and, on short notice, sometimes impossible for us to identify and qualify new
suppliers. Our customers generally restrict our ability to change the components in our products. For more critical components,
any changes may require repeating the entire qualiﬁcation process. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers or a single
qualiﬁed vendor may result in delivery and quality problems, and reduced control over product pricing, reliability and
performance.

Our products could contain defects that may cause us to incur signiﬁcant costs or result in a loss of customers.

        Our products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualiﬁcation by our customers. Our customers'
testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts
of time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected
only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after
customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen
reasons. As a result, we could incur signiﬁcant costs to repair or replace defective products under warranty, particularly

18

Table of Contents

when such failures occur in installed systems. Our products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our
customers' products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules and subsystems and may be expected to interoperate
with modules produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may
be difﬁcult to identify the source of the problem. While we have not experienced material failures in the past, we will continue to
face this risk going forward because our products are widely deployed in many demanding environments and applications
worldwide. In addition, we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty has expired or for problems
not covered by warranty to maintain customer relationships. Any signiﬁcant product failure could result in litigation, damages,
repair costs and lost future sales of the affected product and other products, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from
our product development efforts and cause signiﬁcant customer relations problems, all of which would harm our business.
Although we carry product liability insurance, this insurance may not adequately cover our costs arising from defects in our
products or otherwise.

We face a variety of risks associated with our international sales and operations.

        We currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a signiﬁcant portion of our revenue from sales to international
customers. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, 52.2%, 55.7% and 41.0% of our revenue was derived from sales that occurred outside of
North America, respectively. In addition, a signiﬁcant portion of our manufacturing operations is based in Ningbo, China and
Taipei, Taiwan. Our international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

difﬁculties in stafﬁng, managing and supporting operations in more than one country; 

difﬁculties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; 

fewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions; 

foreign and U.S. taxation issues and international trade barriers; 

difﬁculties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain
foreign jurisdictions; 

ﬂuctuations in foreign economies; 

ﬂuctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates; 

trade and travel restrictions; 

domestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we
currently operate or may operate in the future; 

difﬁculties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade
standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and 

different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may
operate in the future.

19

Table of Contents

        Negative developments in any of these factors in China or Taiwan or other countries could result in a reduction in demand
for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difﬁculties in producing and delivering our products, threats
to our intellectual property, difﬁculty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business. Although we maintain certain
compliance programs throughout the company, violations of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may result in criminal or civil
sanctions, including material monetary ﬁnes, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material
adverse effect on our business.

        Our business operations conducted in China and Taiwan are important to our success. A substantial portion of our property,
plant and equipment is located in China and Taiwan. We expect to make further investments in China and Taiwan in the future.
Therefore, our business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject to economic, political, legal, and
social events and developments in China and Taiwan. China does not recognize the sovereignty of Taiwan. Although signiﬁcant
economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between China and Taiwan, relations have often been
strained and the government of China has previously threatened to use military force to gain control over Taiwan. Factors
affecting military, political or economic conditions in China and Taiwan could have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial
condition and results of operations, as well as the market price and the liquidity of our common shares.

In some instances, we rely on third parties to assist in selling our products, and the failure of those parties to perform as
expected could reduce our future revenue.

        Although we primarily sell our products through direct sales, we also sell our products to some of our customers through
third party sales representatives and distributors. Many of such third parties also market and sell products from our competitors.
Our third party sales representatives and distributors may terminate their relationships with us at any time, or with short notice.
Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional third party sales representatives and
distributors that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not
previously distributed our products. If our current third party sales representatives and distributors fail to perform as expected,
our revenue and results of operations could be harmed.

Failure to manage our growth effectively may adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

        Successful implementation of our business plan in our target markets requires effective planning and management. Our
production volumes are increasing signiﬁcantly and we have announced plans to increase our production capacity in response to
demand for our products, adding both personnel as well as expanding our physical manufacturing facilities. We currently operate
facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. We currently manufacture our lasers using a proprietary
process and customized equipment located only in our Sugar Land, Texas facility, and it will be costly to duplicate that facility to
scale our laser manufacturing capacity or to mitigate the risks associated with operating a single facility. The challenges of
managing our geographically dispersed operations have increased and will continue to increase the demand on our management
systems and resources. Moreover, we are continuing to improve our ﬁnancial and managerial controls, reporting systems and
procedures. Any failure to manage our expansion and the resulting demands on our management systems and resources
effectively may adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

20

Our loan agreements contain restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.

        We have lending arrangements with several ﬁnancial institutions, including loan agreements with East West Bank in the
U.S., and our China subsidiary has a line of credit arrangement. Our loan agreements governing our long-term debt obligations in
the U.S. contain certain ﬁnancial and operating covenants that limit our management's discretion with respect to certain business
matters. Among other things, these covenants require us to maintain certain ﬁnancial ratios and restrict our ability to incur
additional debt, create liens or other encumbrances, change the nature of our business, pay dividends, sell or otherwise dispose of
assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. These restrictions may limit our ﬂexibility in responding to business
opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. Any failure by us or our subsidiaries to
comply with these agreements could harm our business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results. In addition, our obligations
under our U.S. loan agreements with East West Bank are secured by substantially all of our U.S. assets, including our intellectual
property assets, our Sugar Land facility and our equity interests in our subsidiaries, which limits our ability to provide collateral
for additional ﬁnancing. A breach of any of covenants under our loan agreements, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness
when due under any of our credit facilities, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our
indebtedness.

We may not be able to obtain additional capital when desired, on favorable terms or at all.

        We anticipate that the net proceeds we receive from this offering, together with our current cash and short-term investments,
cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our bank loans and credit facilities, will be sufﬁcient to meet
our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes for the next 12 to 24 months. We operate in a market, however,
that makes our prospects difﬁcult to evaluate and, to remain competitive, we will be required to make continued investments in
capital equipment, facilities and technological improvements. We expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our
manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth. If we do not generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂow from
operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs, we may need additional ﬁnancing to
implement our business strategy, which includes:

•

•

•

•

expansion of research and development; 

expansion of manufacturing capabilities; 

hiring of additional technical, sales and other personnel; and 

acquisitions of complementary businesses.

        If we raise additional funds through the issuance of our common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interests of
our stockholders could be signiﬁcantly diluted. These newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to
those of existing stockholders acquiring shares of our common stock in this offering. Additional ﬁnancing may not, however, be
available on terms favorable to us, or at all, if and when needed, and our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of
unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our infrastructure or respond to competitive pressures could be signiﬁcantly
limited. If we cannot raise required capital when needed, we may be unable to meet the demands of existing and

21

Table of Contents

prospective customers, adversely affecting our sales and market opportunities and consequently our business, ﬁnancial condition
and results of operations.

Future acquisitions may adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

        As part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of companies that we believe could enhance or complement our
current product portfolio, augment our technology roadmap or diversify our revenue base. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
any of which could harm our business, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

difﬁculties integrating the acquired business; 

unanticipated costs, capital expenditures or liabilities or changes related to research in progress and product
development; 

diversion of ﬁnancial and management resources from our existing business; 

difﬁculties integrating the business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business with our
existing business relationships; 

risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience; and 

potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organizations.

        Acquisitions may also result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to potential impairment in the
future, adversely affecting our operating results. We may not achieve the anticipated beneﬁts of an acquisition if we fail to
evaluate it properly, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. A failure to evaluate and execute an acquisition
appropriately or otherwise adequately address these risks may adversely affect our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates.

        We have signiﬁcant foreign currency exposure, and are affected by ﬂuctuations among the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi,
or RMB, and the New Taiwan, or NT, dollar because a substantial portion of our business is conducted in China and Taiwan. Our
sales, raw materials, components and capital expenditures are denominated in U.S. dollars, RMB and NT dollars in varying
amounts.

        Foreign currency ﬂuctuations may adversely affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of
operations. The value of the NT dollar or the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may ﬂuctuate and be affected by,
among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. The RMB currency is no longer being pegged solely to the
value of the U.S. dollar. While the international reaction to the RMB revaluation has generally been positive, there remains
signiﬁcant international pressure on the Chinese government to adopt an even more ﬂexible currency policy, which may result in
a further and more signiﬁcant appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. In the long term, the RMB may appreciate or
depreciate signiﬁcantly in value against the U.S. dollar, depending upon the ﬂuctuation of the basket of currencies against which
it is currently valued, or it may be permitted to enter into a full ﬂoat, which may also result in a signiﬁcant appreciation or
depreciation of the RMB against

22

Table of Contents

the U.S. dollar. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magniﬁed by Chinese exchange control regulations that
restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.

        Our sales in Europe are denominated in U.S. dollars, and ﬂuctuations in the Euro or our customers' other local currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar may impact our customers and affect our ﬁnancial performance. If our customers' local currencies
weaken against the U.S. dollar, we may need to lower our prices to remain competitive in our international markets which could
have a material adverse effect on our margins. If our customers' local currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar and if the local
sales prices cannot be raised due to competitive pressures, we will experience a deterioration of our margins.

        To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange
risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging
transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure.

Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could harm our operations.

        Our operations in the U.S., China and Taiwan could be subject to signiﬁcant risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes,
hurricanes, typhoons, ﬂooding and tornadoes, as well as other catastrophic events, such as epidemics, terrorist attacks or wars.
For example, our corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas, is located near Gulf of Mexico, an
area that is susceptible to hurricanes. We use a proprietary MBE laser manufacturing process that requires customized equipment,
and this process is currently conducted and located solely at our wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas, such that a
natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that affects that facility would materially harm our operations. In
addition, our manufacturing facility in Taipei, Taiwan, is susceptible to typhoons, and our manufacturing facility in Ningbo,
China, has from time to time, suffered electrical outages. Any disruption in our manufacturing facilities arising from these and
other natural disasters or other catastrophic events could cause signiﬁcant delays in the production or shipment of our products
until we are able to shift production to different facilities or arrange for third parties to manufacture our products. We may not be
able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms or at all. Our property insurance coverage with respect to natural disaster is
limited and is subject to deductible and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at
commercially reasonable rates and terms. The occurrence of any of these circumstances may adversely affect our ﬁnancial
condition and results of operation.

If we fail to protect, or incur signiﬁcant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business
and results of operations could be materially harmed.

        Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination
of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual
provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations
in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some of which have been issued. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks in
the U.S. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.
Moreover, our existing and future patents and trademarks may not be sufﬁciently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may
be held invalid or unenforceable in court. A failure to obtain patents or trademark registrations or a successful challenge to our
registrations in the U.S. or other foreign countries may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these
applications and registrations intended to cover.

23

Table of Contents

        Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difﬁcult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent
the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to
effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we
have not applied for patent protections, and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws
may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law. We may seek to secure comparable intellectual
property protections in other countries. However, the level of protection afforded by patent and other laws in other countries may
not be comparable to that afforded in the U.S.

        We also attempt to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade
secret and other intellectual property laws, and contractual provisions. We enter into conﬁdentiality and invention assignment
agreements with our employees and independent consultants. We also use non-disclosure agreements with other third parties who
may have access to our proprietary technologies and information. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and
there can be no assurance that our conﬁdentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, especially after our
employees end their employment, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will
have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Unauthorized third parties may
try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, or
may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and
other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed or misappropriated, our business,
results of operations or ﬁnancial condition could be materially harmed.

        In the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights
and determining their validity and scope could result in signiﬁcant litigation costs and require signiﬁcant time and attention from
our technical and management personnel, which could signiﬁcantly harm our business. We may not prevail in such proceedings,
and an adverse outcome may adversely impact our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our ﬁnancial condition and our
business.

We may be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future, which could divert management's attention, cause us to
incur signiﬁcant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology.

        Participants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights. While we have a policy in place that is designed to reduce the risk of infringement of intellectual
property rights of others and we have conducted a limited review of other companies' relevant patents, there can be no assurance
that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. We cannot be certain that our products would not be found
infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming,
divert management's attention and resources and may cause us to incur signiﬁcant expenses. Intellectual property claims against
us could force us to do one or more of the following:

•

obtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to the relevant technology, which may not be available
on reasonable terms, or at all;

24

Table of Contents

•

•

•

stop manufacturing, selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property; 

pay substantial monetary damages; or 

expend signiﬁcant resources to redesign the products that use the technology and to develop non-infringing
technology.

        Any of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period
of time.

        In any potential intellectual property dispute, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often
indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them with respect to our products, any claims against our
customers could trigger indemniﬁcation claims against us. These obligations could result in substantial expenses such as legal
expenses, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use. Any indemnity claim could also adversely affect our
relationships with our customers and result in substantial costs to us.

If we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual property rights of others that are necessary to operate our business, and to
protect their intellectual property, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.

        From time to time we may choose to or be required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in
connection with the development of our products. We cannot assure you that third party licenses will be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Generally, a license, if granted, would include payments of up-front fees, ongoing
royalties or both. These payments or other terms could have a signiﬁcant adverse impact on our results of operations. Our
inability to obtain a necessary third party license required for our product offerings or to develop new products and product
enhancements could require us to substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or of greater cost, either of
which could adversely affect our business. If we are not able to obtain licenses from third parties, if necessary, then we may also
be subject to litigation to defend against infringement claims from these third parties. Our competitors may be able to obtain
licenses or cross-license their technology on better terms than we can, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

If we fail to maintain effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our ﬁnancial
reporting may be adversely affected.

        Preparing our consolidated ﬁnancial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are
dependent upon individual data input or review and require signiﬁcant management judgment. One or more of these elements
may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
We have not performed an evaluation of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, such as would be required by Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, nor have we engaged our independent registered public accounting ﬁrm to perform an audit of our
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. In addition, for so long as we qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS
Act, which may be up to ﬁve years following our initial public offering in September 2013, we will not have to provide an
auditor's attestation report on our internal controls in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. During the course of any evaluation, documentation or attestation, we or our independent registered
public accounting ﬁrm may identify weaknesses and deﬁciencies that

25

Table of Contents

we may not otherwise identify in a timely manner or at all as a result of the deferred implementation of this additional level of
review. In connection with the audit of our ﬁnancial statements for the period ended December 31, 2012, we identiﬁed a material
weakness related to the inappropriate recording of certain inventory returned for re-work in China as a reduction in cost of sales.
We remediated this material weakness in 2013 and we did not identify any material weaknesses in connection with the audit of
our ﬁnancial statements for the period ended December 31, 2013.

        We have implemented internal controls that we believe provide reasonable assurance that we will be able to avoid
accounting errors or material weaknesses in future periods. However, our internal controls cannot guarantee that no accounting
errors exist or that all accounting errors, no matter how immaterial, will be detected because a control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. If
we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely
report our ﬁnancial results could be adversely impacted. This could result in late ﬁlings of our annual and quarterly reports under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, restatements of our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, a decline in our
stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock by NASDAQ, or other material adverse effects on our business,
reputation, results of operations or ﬁnancial condition.

Our ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

        As of December 31, 2013, we had U.S. accumulated net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $65.7 million for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. We also had research and development credit carry forwards totaling $1.6 million as of
December 31, 2013, which begin to expire in 2020. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs, capital loss carry
forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. An ownership change is generally
deﬁned as a greater than 50% change in equity ownership by value over a 3-year period. Based upon an analysis of our equity
ownership, we have experienced an ownership change and our NOL carry forwards are limited in dollar amount. As of
December 31, 2013, of the total accumulated NOL, only $40.3 million is available for utilization in 2014 and thereafter to shelter
federal taxable income. Each year after 2014, an additional $0.3 million is added to the total available NOL, until a maximum of
$43.9 million is reached. The amount of NOL available each year may decrease by the amount of NOL utilized and may increase
by the amount of any operating losses incurred. Should we experience additional ownership changes, our NOL carry forwards
may be further limited.

Changes in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operation and our business.

        We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions, including China. We base our tax position on the
anticipated nature and conduct of our business and our understanding of the tax laws of the countries in which we have assets or
conduct activities. Our tax position may be reviewed or challenged by tax authorities. Moreover, the tax laws currently in effect
may change, and such changes may have retroactive effect. We have inter-company arrangements in place providing for
administrative and ﬁnancing services and transfer pricing, which involve a signiﬁcant degree of judgment and are often subject to
close review by tax authorities. The tax authorities may challenge our positions related to these agreements. If the tax authorities
successfully challenge our positions, our effective tax rate may increase, adversely affecting our results of operation and our
business.

26

Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental regulation that could limit our growth or impose substantial
costs, adversely affecting our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

        Our properties, operations and products are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which
we operate and sell products. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the
management and disposal of hazardous materials, the contamination of soil and groundwater, employee health and safety and the
content, performance, packaging and disposal of products. Our failure to comply with current and future environmental laws and
regulations, or the identiﬁcation of contamination for which we are liable, could subject us to substantial costs, including ﬁnes,
clean-up costs, third-party property damages or personal injury claims, and make signiﬁcant investments to upgrade our facilities
or curtail our operations. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to
fault or negligence. For example, pursuant to environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, we may be liable for the full amount of any remediation-
related costs at properties we currently own or formerly owned, such as our currently owned Sugar Land, Texas facility, or at
properties at which we operated, as well as at properties we will own or operate in the future, and properties to which we have
sent hazardous substances, whether or not we caused the contamination. Identiﬁcation of presently unidentiﬁed environmental
conditions, more vigorous enforcement by a governmental authority, enactment of more stringent legal requirements or other
unanticipated events could give rise to adverse publicity, restrict our operations, affect the design or marketability of our products
or otherwise cause us to incur material environmental costs, adversely affecting our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.

        We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery
or other prohibited payments to foreign ofﬁcials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to
maintain records that accurately and fairly represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting
controls. Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions, and therefore
may have a competitive advantage over us. If we are not successful in implementing and maintaining adequate preventative
measures, we may be responsible for acts of our employees or other agents engaging in such conduct. We could suffer severe
penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in
international markets.

        We are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products
we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. Speciﬁcally, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of
Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of most commercial items that are so called dual-use goods that may have both
commercial and military applications. A limited number of our products are exported by license under the Export Control
Classiﬁcation Number, or ECCN, of 5A991. Export Control Classiﬁcation requirements are dependent upon an item's technical
characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the end-user, and other activities of the end-user. Should the regulations
applicable to our products change, or the restrictions applicable to countries to

27

Table of Contents

which we ship our products change, then the export of our products to such countries could be restricted. As a result, our ability
to export or sell our products to certain countries could be restricted, which could adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial
condition and results of operations. Changes in our products or any change in export or import regulations or related legislation,
shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted
by such regulations, could result in delayed or decreased sales of our products to existing or potential customers. In such event,
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Rapidly changing standards and regulations could make our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and results of
operations to suffer.

        We design our products to conform to regulations established by governments and to standards set by industry standards
bodies worldwide, such as The American National Standards Institute, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the
International Telecommunications Union and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. Various industry
organizations are currently considering whether and to what extent to create standards applicable to our products. Because certain
of our products are designed to conform to current speciﬁc industry standards, if competing or new standards emerge that are
preferred by our customers, we would have to make signiﬁcant expenditures to develop new products. If our customers adopt
new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible, or the industry groups adopt standards or
governments issue regulations with which our products are not compatible, our existing products would become less desirable to
our customers and our revenue and results of operations would suffer.

Customer demands and new regulations related to conﬂict-free minerals may adversely affect us.

        The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use
of "conﬂict" minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these
products are manufactured by third parties. These new requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals
used in the manufacture of our products. Certain of our customers are requiring additional information from us regarding the
origin of our raw materials, and complying with these customer requirements may cause us to incur additional costs, such as costs
related to determining the origin of any minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to
verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our customers and stockholders if
we are unable to certify that our products are conﬂict free.

Risks Related to Our Operations in China

Adverse changes in economic and political policies in China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse
effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.

        The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of
government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The
Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Despite reforms, the
government continues to exercise signiﬁcant control over China's economic growth by way of the allocation of resources, control
over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular
industries or companies.

28

Table of Contents

        In addition, the laws, regulations and legal requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested
enterprises, or FIEs, are subject to frequent changes. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws is uncertain. Protections of
intellectual property rights and conﬁdentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions with
more developed legal systems. Any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources
and management attention. Any adverse changes to these laws, regulations and legal requirements or their interpretation or
enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our business.

        Furthermore, while China's economy has experienced rapid growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across
different regions, among various economic sectors and over time. China has also in the past and may in the future experience
economic downturns due to, for example, government austerity measures, changes in government policies relating to capital
spending, limitations placed on the ability of commercial banks to make loans, reduced levels of exports and international trade,
inﬂation, lack of ﬁnancial liquidity, stock market volatility and global economic conditions. Any of these developments could
contribute to a decline in business and consumer spending in addition to other adverse market conditions, which could adversely
affect our business.

The termination and expiration or unavailability of our preferential tax treatments in China may have a material adverse
effect on our operating results.

        Prior to January 1, 2008, entities established in China were generally subject to a 30% state and 3% local enterprise income
tax rate. In accordance with the China Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises,
effective through December 31, 2007, our China subsidiary enjoyed preferential income tax rates. Effective January 1, 2008, the
China Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT law, imposes a single uniform income tax rate of 25% on all Chinese enterprises,
including FIEs, and eliminates or modiﬁes most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatment available under the
previous tax laws and regulations. As a result, our China subsidiary may be subject to the uniform income tax rate of 25% unless
we are able to qualify for preferential status. Currently, we have qualiﬁed for a preferential 15% tax rate that is available for new
and high technology enterprises. The preferential rate applies to calendar years 2012, 2013 and 2014. We have not yet realized
beneﬁts from this reduction in tax rate because we have not yet generated taxable income in China. Any future increase in the
enterprise income tax rate applicable to us or the expiration or other limitation of preferential tax rates available to us could
increase our tax liabilities and reduce our net income.

China regulation of loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to China entities may delay or prevent us from
using the proceeds we receive from this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiary.

        In utilizing the proceeds we receive from this offering, we may make loans or additional capital contributions to our China
subsidiary. Any loans to our China subsidiary are subject to China regulations and approvals. For example, any loans to our
China subsidiary to ﬁnance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits, must be registered with State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterpart, and must be approved by the relevant government authorities. Any capital
contributions to our China subsidiary must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, under
Circular 142, our China subsidiary, as a FIE, may not be able to convert our capital contributions to them into RMB for equity
investments or acquisitions in China.

29

Table of Contents

        We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all,
with respect to our future loans or capital contributions to our China subsidiary. If we fail to receive such registrations or
approvals, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our China subsidiary may be negatively affected,
which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.

Our China subsidiary is subject to Chinese labor laws and regulations and Chinese labor laws may increase our operating
costs in China.

        The China Labor Contract Law, together with its implementing rules, provides increased rights to Chinese employees.
Previously, an employer had discretionary power in deciding the probation period, not to exceed six months. Additionally, the
employment contract could only be terminated for cause. Under these rules, the probation period varies depending on contract
terms and the employment contract can only be terminated during the probation period for cause upon three days' notice.
Additionally, an employer may not be able to terminate a contract during the probation period on the grounds of a material
change of circumstances or a mass layoff. The new law also has speciﬁc provisions on conditions when an employer has to sign
an employment contract with open-ended terms. If an employer fails to enter into an open-ended contract in certain
circumstances, the employer must pay the employee twice their monthly wage beginning from the time the employer should have
executed an open-ended contract. Additionally an employer must pay severance for nearly all terminations, including when an
employer decides not to renew a ﬁxed-term contract. These laws may increase our costs and reduce our ﬂexibility.

The turnover of direct labor in manufacturing industries in China is high, which could adversely affect our production,
shipments and results of operations.

        Employee turnover of direct labor in the manufacturing sector in China is high and retention of such personnel is a challenge
to companies located in or with operations in China. Although direct labor costs do not represent a high proportion of our overall
manufacturing costs, direct labor is required for the manufacture of our products. If our direct labor turnover rates are higher than
we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage our direct labor turnover rates, then our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

An increase in our labor costs in China may adversely affect our business and our proﬁtability.

        A signiﬁcant portion of our workforce is located in China. Labor costs in China have been increasing recently due to labor
unrest, strikes and changes in employment laws. If labor costs in China continue to increase, our costs will increase. If we are not
able to pass these increases on to our customers, our business, proﬁtability and results of operations may be adversely affected.

We may have difﬁculty establishing and maintaining adequate management and ﬁnancial controls over our China operations.

        Businesses in China have historically not adopted a western style of management and ﬁnancial reporting concepts and
practices, which includes strong corporate governance, internal controls and computer, ﬁnancial and other control systems.
Moreover, familiarity with U.S. GAAP principles and reporting procedures is less common in China. As a consequence, we may
have difﬁculty ﬁnding accounting personnel experienced with U.S. GAAP, and we may have difﬁculty training and integrating
our China-based accounting staff with our U.S.-based

30

Table of Contents

ﬁnance organization. As a result of these factors, we may experience difﬁculty in establishing management and ﬁnancial controls
over our China operations. These difﬁculties include collecting ﬁnancial data and preparing ﬁnancial statements, books of
account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet U.S. public-company reporting requirements. We may,
in turn, experience difﬁculties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Risks Related to This Offering and Our Common Stock

Our principal stockholders, executive ofﬁcers and directors own a signiﬁcant percentage of our stock and have signiﬁcant
control of our management and affairs, and they can take actions that may be against your best interests.

        Following the completion of this offering, our executive ofﬁcers and directors, and entities that are afﬁliated with them, will
beneﬁcially own an aggregate of approximately         % of our outstanding common stock, based on an assumed offering price of
$         per share. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, may have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over our management and affairs
and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of signiﬁcant corporate transactions,
such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may
have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination
involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if
such a change in control would beneﬁt our other stockholders.

Our stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.

        Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could
cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difﬁcult for us to sell equity or
equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Upon completion of this offering, we will
have an aggregate of                  shares of common stock outstanding based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and
assuming no exercise of options or warrants after such date. The 2,700,000 shares sold pursuant to this offering will be, and the
4,140,000 shares sold in our initial public offering are, immediately tradable without restriction. Of the remaining shares,

•

•

•

approximately 0.1 million shares are eligible for immediate sale; 

approximately              million shares are expected to become eligible for sale on March 25, 2014 upon the
expiration of lock-up agreements executed in connection with our initial public offering, subject in some cases to
volume and other restrictions of Rules 144 and 701under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities
Act, and various vesting agreements; and 

approximately              million shares are expected to become eligible for sale upon the expiration of 90-day lock-
up agreements entered into in connection with this offering, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions
of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, or the Securities Act, and various vesting agreements.

        The lock-up agreements entered into in connection with this offering expire 90 days after the date of this prospectus, subject
to potential extensions in the event we release earning results

31

Table of Contents

or material news or a material event relating to us occurs near the end of the lock-up period and in the event that we cease to be
an emerging growth company. Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Piper Jaffray & Co., as representatives of the underwriters
may, in their sole discretion and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the securities subject to lock-up
agreements.

        On November 19, 2013, we registered 2,600,000 shares of our common stock under our equity plans, which shares will be
eligible for sale upon the expiration of lock-up agreements (which expiration is expected to occur on March 25, 2014), subject in
some cases to volume and other restrictions under Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, and various vesting agreements.

Because our offering price is substantially higher than the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our outstanding
common stock, investors participating in this offering will incur immediate and substantial dilution.

        The offering price is substantially higher than the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock based
on the expected total value of our total assets, less our goodwill and other intangible assets, less our total liabilities immediately
following this offering. Therefore, if you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you will experience immediate
and substantial dilution of $                           per share in the price you pay for our common stock compared to the as adjusted net
tangible book value as of December 31, 2013. Furthermore, investors purchasing our common stock in this offering will own
only                           % of our shares outstanding even though they will have contributed                           % of the total
consideration received by us in connection with our sales of common stock. To the extent outstanding options to purchase
common stock are exercised, there will be further dilution. For a further description of the dilution that you will experience
immediately after this offering, see the section titled "Dilution."

We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a
return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.

        We currently do not plan to declare or pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition,
the terms of our loan and security agreement with East West Bank restrict our ability to pay dividends. See "Dividend Policy" for
more information. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on the shares you purchase in this offering will be if
the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a proﬁt. There is no guarantee that the price of our
common stock in the market after this offering will ever exceed the price that you pay.

Our charter documents, stock incentive plans and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable
and could also reduce the market price of our stock.

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and our stock incentive plans
contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more
difﬁcult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:

•

•

providing for a classiﬁed board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; 

not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;

32

Table of Contents

•

•

•

•

•

authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of
common stock; 

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; 

limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; 

requiring advance notiﬁcation of stockholder nominations and proposals; and 

change of control provisions in our stock incentive plans, and the individual stock option agreements, which
provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of the stock options issued under such plans.

        In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law governs us. These provisions may
prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain
business combinations without the approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time.

        These and other provisions in our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and
under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for
shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.
See "Description of Capital Stock—Preferred stock" and "Description of Capital Stock—Anti-takeover effects of Delaware law."

Some provisions of our named executive ofﬁcers' agreements regarding change of control or separation of service contain
obligations for us to make separation payments to them upon their termination.

        Certain provisions contained in our employment agreements with our named executive ofﬁcers regarding change of control
or separation of service may obligate us to make lump sum severance payments and related payments upon the termination of
their employment with us, other than such executive ofﬁcer's resignation without good reason or our termination of their
employment as a result of their disability or for cause. In the event we are required to make these separation payments, it could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the ﬁscal period in which such payments are made. For a further
description of the separation beneﬁts that we may be obligated to pay upon such termination of these executives, see the section
titled "Management—Agreements with Executive Ofﬁcers."

Our stock price has been and is likely to be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the offering price.

        The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be subject to wide ﬂuctuations in response to, among other
things, the risk factors described in this section of this prospectus, and other factors beyond our control, such as ﬂuctuations in the
valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us.

        Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume ﬂuctuations that have affected and continue to affect the
market prices of equity securities of many companies. These ﬂuctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry ﬂuctuations, as well as general economic, political

33

Table of Contents

and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency ﬂuctuations, may negatively affect the
market price of our common stock.

        In the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities
class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result
in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our
business.

As an "emerging growth company" within the meaning of the Securities Act, we will utilize certain modiﬁed disclosure
requirements, and we cannot be certain if these reduced requirements will make our common stock less attractive to investors.

        We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act. We have in this prospectus
utilized, and we plan in future ﬁlings with the SEC to continue to utilize, the modiﬁed disclosure requirements available to
emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation and omission of compensation
discussion and analysis, and an exemption from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive
compensation and an exemption from the requirement that outside auditors attest as to our internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.

        In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an
emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies. We have elected to utilize this extended transition period. Our ﬁnancial statements may therefore not be
comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards as they become applicable to
public companies.

        We cannot predict if investors will ﬁnd our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some
investors ﬁnd our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and
our stock price may be more volatile. We could remain an "emerging growth company" for up to ﬁve years, or until the earliest of
(i) the last day of the ﬁrst ﬁscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large
accelerated ﬁler" as deﬁned in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock
that is held by non-afﬁliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second ﬁscal quarter
or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.

If research analysts do not publish research about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our
common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

        The trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us
and our business. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our common stock or
if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more of the
research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease,
which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INDUSTRY DATA 

        This prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus are forward-looking
statements, including statements regarding our future ﬁnancial position, sources of revenue, business strategy and plans,
prospective products, product approvals or products under development, costs, timing and likelihood of success, gross margins,
and objectives of management for future operations. In particular, many of the statements under the headings "Prospectus
summary," "Risk Factors," "Management's discussion and analysis of ﬁnancial condition and results of operations" and
"Business" constitute forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology
such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," "continue," the
negative of these terms, or by other similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these
forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions, involving known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. We discuss many of these factors, risks and uncertainties in greater detail under the heading "Risk Factors" and
elsewhere in this prospectus. These factors expressly qualify all oral and written forward-looking statements attributable to us or
persons acting on our behalf.

        You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations
reﬂected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements. Actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements for various reasons,
including those discussed under "Risk Factors" in this prospectus. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update
forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results or to
changes in our expectations.

        This prospectus contains market data and certain other statistical information based on independent industry publications,
governmental publications, reports by market research ﬁrms or other independent sources, including those generated by Akamai,
Cisco, Infonetics and Ovum Limited, as well as our internal research. Some data is also based on our internal estimates. Industry
publications, surveys and market research reports generally state that the information contained in them has been obtained from
sources believed by the sources' authors to be reliable, but we have not independently veriﬁed any of the data from third party
sources nor have we investigated the underlying economic assumptions on which such data are based. We commissioned certain
Ovum research referenced in the sections "Prospectus Summary" and "Business" in this prospectus and contributed to its
preparation. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations. The markets in which we operate are subject to
a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in the section of this prospectus titled
"Risk Factors."

USE OF PROCEEDS 

        We estimate that the net proceeds of the sale by us of our common stock in this offering will be approximately
$            million, based on an assumed public offering price of $           per share, which was the closing price of our common
stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on March     , 2014, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the
selling stockholders.

        We do not have current speciﬁc plans for the use of the net proceeds from this offering. We generally intend to use the net
proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including developing new technologies,
funding capital expenditures or making investments in or acquisitions of other businesses, solutions or technologies. Pending any
use above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, short-term, interest-bearing securities. Management will have
signiﬁcant ﬂexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. The amount and timing of our actual spending for these
purposes may vary signiﬁcantly from our plans and will depend on a number of factors, including our future revenues, cash
generated by operations and other factors described under the heading "Risk Factors." We may ﬁnd it necessary or advisable to
use portions of the proceeds for other purposes.

DIVIDEND POLICY 

        We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends
on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings for use in
the operation and expansion of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board
of directors and will depend upon our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, terms of ﬁnancing arrangements, applicable
Delaware law, capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. In addition, the terms of our
loan agreements governing our long-term debt obligations prohibit us from paying dividends.

DILUTION 

        If you invest in our common stock, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the offering price per
share of our common stock and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock after this offering. We
calculate actual net tangible book value per share by dividing the net tangible book value, or tangible assets less total liabilities,
by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. Our actual net tangible book value at December 31, 2013, was
$              million, or $             per share.

        After giving effect to the sale of the 1,300,000 shares of common stock by us at an assumed offering price of $             per
share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as
adjusted net tangible book value at December 31, 2013, would be $              million, or $             per share. This represents an
immediate increase in the net tangible book value of $             per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of
$             per share to investors purchasing shares at offering price of $             per share. The following table illustrates this per
share dilution:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

        You should read the following discussion and analysis of our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations in conjunction
with our consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion
and other parts of this prospectus contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of
our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-
looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in
"Risk Factors."

Overview

        We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of ﬁber-optic networking products. We target three networking end-markets:
CATV, FTTH and internet data centers. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels
of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing products for our
customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we
design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers' needs and speciﬁcations, and such products differ from
each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance
segments within the CATV, FTTH and internet data center markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity and
innovation. Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development,
fast response times to customer requests and control over product quality and manufacturing costs.

        The three end markets we target are all driven by signiﬁcant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected
devices, video trafﬁc, cloud computing and online social networking. Within the CATV market, we beneﬁt from a number of
ongoing trends including the global build-out of CATV infrastructure, the move to higher bandwidth networks among CATV
service providers and the outsourcing of system design among CATV networking equipment companies. In the FTTH market, we
beneﬁt from continuing PON deployments and system upgrades among telecommunication service providers. Within the internet
data center market, we beneﬁt from the increasing use of higher-capacity optical networking technology as a replacement for
copper cables, particularly as speeds reach 10 gigabits per second and above, as well as the movement to open internet data
center architectures and the increasing use of in-house equipment design among leading internet companies.

        We sell our products to leading original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in the CATV and FTTH markets as well as
internet data center operators. In 2013, we earned 60.4% of our total revenue from the CATV market, and 24.7% of our total
revenue from the data center market. In 2013, our key customers in the CATV market included Cisco Systems and Biogenomics
Corp., a distributor. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Cisco Systems accounted for 26.8%, 33.2%, and 21.8%, respectively, of our revenue
and Biogenomics Corp. accounted for 11.7%, 11.2% and 8.7%, respectively, of our revenue. In 2013, our key customers that
contributed most to our FTTH revenue were Genexis B.V. and a leading internet service provider, which accounted for 2.8% and
2.0% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2013, our key customers in the data center market included Amazon and Microsoft. In
2012 and 2013, Amazon accounted for 5.8% and 18.2% of our revenue, respectively, and Microsoft accounted for 2.6% and 6.1%
of our revenue, respectively. In 2013, revenue from the CATV market, data center market, FTTH market and other markets
provided 60.4%, 24.7%, 5.6%, and 9.3% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 78.6%, 8.3%, 5.8% and 7.3% of our 2012
revenue, respectively.

        Our sales model focuses on direct engagement and close coordination with our customers to determine product design,
qualiﬁcations, performance and price. Our strategy is to use our direct sales force to sell to key accounts and to expand our use of
distributors for increased coverage in certain international markets and certain domestic market segments. We have direct sales
personnel that cover the U.S., Taiwan and China focusing primarily on major OEM customers and internet data center operators.
Throughout our sales cycle, we work closely with our customers to qualify our products into their product lines. As a result, we
strive to build strategic and long-lasting customer relationships and deliver products that are customized to our customers'
requirements.

        Our business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes to develop components, systems and equipment for
use in our customers' products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result, our sales cycles will vary based on
the level of customization required, market served, whether the design win is with an existing or new customer and whether our
solution being designed in our customers' product is our ﬁrst generation or subsequent generation product. We do not have any
long-term purchase commitments (in excess of one year) with any of our customers, all of whom purchase our products on a
purchase order basis. Once one of our solutions is incorporated into a customer's design, however, we believe that our solution is
likely to continue to be purchased for that design throughout that product's life cycle because of the time and expense associated
with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative solution.

        In 2011, 2012 and 2013, we had 11, 15 and 17 design wins, respectively. We deﬁne a design win as the successful
completion of the evaluation stage, where our customer has tested our product, veriﬁed that our product meets substantially all of
their requirements and has informed us that they intend to purchase the product from us. Although we believe that our ability to
obtain design wins is a key strength and can provide meaningful and recurring revenue, an increase or decrease in the mere
number of design wins does not necessarily correlate to a likely increase or decrease in revenue, particularly in the short term. As
such, the number of design wins we achieve on a quarterly or annual basis and any increase or decrease in design wins will not
necessarily result in a corresponding increase or decrease in revenue in the same or immediately succeeding quarter or year. For
example, if our total number of design wins in an annual or quarterly period increases or decreases compared to the total number
of design wins in a prior period, this does not necessarily mean that our revenue in such period will be higher or lower than our
revenue in the prior period. In fact, our experience is that some design wins result in signiﬁcant revenue and some do not, and the
timing of such revenue is difﬁcult to predict as it depends on the success of the end customer's product that uses our components.
Thus, some design wins result in orders and signiﬁcant revenue shortly after the design win is awarded and other design wins do
not result in signiﬁcant orders and revenue for several months or longer after the initial design win (if at all). We do believe that
over a period of years the collective impact of design wins correlates to our overall revenue growth.

        We believe we have an attractive ﬁnancial proﬁle, with strong revenue performance and control over our manufacturing
costs through our vertically integrated manufacturing model. While we have incurred substantial losses since our inception, and
as of December 31, 2013 had an accumulated deﬁcit of $83.3 million, we achieved proﬁtability (net income on a GAAP basis) in
the third quarter of 2013 and recorded a slight loss ($0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2013. We have grown our revenue at a
33.1% CAGR between 2009 and 2013, including 23.7% growth year-over-year from 2012 to 2013.

Factors Affecting Our Performance

        Increasing Consumer Demand for Bandwidth.    Bandwidth demand in all of our target markets is driving service provider
investment in new equipment and in turn generating demand for our products. Increasingly, optical networking technologies are
being incorporated into networking equipment, replacing legacy copper-based networking technologies. This shift to optical
networking solutions beneﬁts us as a provider of those solutions.

        Pricing, Product Cost and Margins.    Our solution pricing varies depending upon the end market, the complexity of the
product and the level of competition. Our product costs also vary with complexity as well as the degree to which we can utilize
components designed and manufactured ourselves. We tend to realize higher gross margins on products that incorporate a higher
percentage of our own components. We often initially experience lower gross margins on new products, as our pricing is based
upon anticipated volume-driven cost reductions over the life of the design win. Thus, if we are unable to realize our expected cost
reductions, we may experience declining gross margins on such products.

        Our product pricing is established when the product is initially introduced to the market, and thereafter through periodic
negotiations with customers. We generally do not agree to periodic automatic price reductions. Furthermore, due to the dynamics
in the CATV market and the value of our outsourced design services to our customers, we believe we face less downward price
pressure than many of our competitors. We sell a wide variety of products among our three target markets and our gross margin is
heavily dependent in any quarter on the product mix achieved during that period.

        Decreasing Customer Concentration within End Markets.    Historically, our revenue has been signiﬁcantly concentrated
within the CATV market and among a few customers within this market. Over the past two years, we have developed new
products within the FTTH and internet data center markets. Furthermore, we have developed additional original design
manufacturer, or ODM, relationships with customers in each of our target markets which should enable us to diversify our
revenue. Although the CATV market is our largest market today, we anticipate that sales in the FTTH and internet data center
markets will account for a more signiﬁcant percentage of our total revenue in the future. We believe that our entry into the FTTH
and internet data center markets with new customers and with new products will continue to facilitate revenue growth and
customer diversiﬁcation.

        Product Development.    We invest heavily to develop new and innovative products. The majority of our research and
development expense is allocated to product development, usually with a speciﬁc customer and customer platform in mind. We
believe our close coordination with our customers regarding their future product requirements enhances the efﬁciency of our
research and development expenditures.

Discussion of Financial Performance

Revenue

        We generate revenue through the sale of our products to equipment providers for the CATV, FTTH and internet data center
markets. We derive a signiﬁcant portion of our revenue from our top ten customers, and we anticipate that we will continue to do
so for the foreseeable future. We also anticipate that our revenue derived from the FTTH and internet data center markets will
increase as a percentage of our revenue as we further penetrate and extend our products into these markets. The following chart
provides the revenue contribution from each of the markets

        In 2011, 2012, and 2013, our top ten customers represented 76.6%, 77.6% and 76.9% of our revenue, respectively. While the
percentage earned from our top ten customers remained consistent, the increase in data center revenue, from 8.3% in 2012 to
24.7% in 2013 resulted in more diversiﬁcation across our top ten customers. In 2013, our key customers in the CATV market
included Cisco Systems, Biogenomics Corp., a distributor in China, and Aurora Networks. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Cisco
Systems accounted for 26.8%, 33.2%, and 21.8%, respectively, of our revenue and Biogenomics Corp. accounted for 11.7%,
11.2% and 8.7%, respectively, of our revenue. In 2013, our key customers in the data center market included Amazon and
Microsoft. In 2012 and 2013, Amazon accounted for 5.8% and 18.2% of our revenue, respectively, and Microsoft accounted for
2.6% and 6.1% of our revenue, respectively. In 2013, our key customers that contributed most to our FTTH revenue were
Genexis B.V. and a leading internet service provider, which accounted for 2.8% and 2.0% of our total revenue, respectively.

        Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the customer. We bear all costs and risks of
loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms of sale provide that title passes to the customer upon
placement by us with a common carrier (upon shipment). A majority of our annual sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, but
some sales from our Taiwan location and China-based subsidiary are denominated in NT dollars and RMB, respectively. For the
year ended December 31, 2013, 17.4% of our total revenue was derived from our China-based subsidiary, with $6.3 million
denominated in RMB, $2.0 million sold directly by our Taiwan location and an immaterial amount denominated in NT dollars.
We expect a similar portion of our sales to be denominated in foreign currencies in 2014.

        During the three year period from 2011 to 2013, our average sales price across our product lines declined less than 8.0%.
Certain of our competitors in the optical industry, who may have narrower market focus than us or broader product lines within a
market, have publically stated that they typically experience annual price declines of 10-15%. Revenue from period to period is
driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures, among other factors.

Cost of goods sold and gross margin

        Our cost of goods sold consists of material costs, direct labor, allocated overhead and periodic cost variances, including
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, with each representing approximately 65.1%, 12.6%, 17.3%, 5.0% of our total cost of
goods sold, respectively, in 2013.

        Our cost of goods sold is impacted by variances arising from changes in yields and production volume. We typically
experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products. In general, our cost of goods sold for a particular product
declines over time as a result of increasing efﬁciencies in the manufacturing processes, or supply cost declines, as well as yield
improvements and testing enhancements.

        We manufacture our products in all three of our facilities in the U.S., Taiwan and China. Generally, laser chips and optical
components are manufactured in our U.S. facility, optical components and subassemblies are manufactured in our Taiwan facility,
and equipment is manufactured in our China facility. Because of our vertical integration model, we utilize our own products in
our semi-ﬁnished and ﬁnished goods that we sell between and among our respective manufacturing operations. We base those
internal sales upon established transfer pricing methodologies. However, we eliminate all of those internal sales, and cost of
goods sold transactions, to arrive at total revenue and cost of goods sold on a consolidated basis.

        We have a global set of suppliers to help balance considerations related to product availability, quality and cost. Components
of our cost of goods sold are denominated in U.S. or NT dollars or RMB, depending upon the manufacturing location.

        Gross proﬁt as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and is expected to continue to be affected by a
variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, production volumes, the mix of products sold, the geographic
region in which products are sold, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor
costs, changes in overhead costs, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories and changes in the average selling prices of our
products. Although our overall gross margins over the past three years have been between 28.0% and 32.9%, our gross margins
vary more broadly on a product-by-product basis. Our newer and more advanced products typically have higher average selling
prices and higher gross margins; however, until the product volumes scale, the gross margin from newer and advanced products
may initially be lower. Within our markets, we sell similar products to different geographic regions at different prices, and
therefore realize different gross margins among those similar products. We generally realize a lower gross margin in sales to
Asian markets. Our strategy is to improve our gross margins through vertical integration such as utilization of our own laser chips
and optical sub-components in our solutions. We expect that our gross margins are likely to continue to ﬂuctuate from quarter to
quarter because of the variety of products we sell and the relative product mix within a quarter.

Operating expenses

        Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.
Personnel costs are the most signiﬁcant component of operating expenses and include salaries, beneﬁts, bonuses and share-based
compensation. With regard to sales and marketing expense, personnel costs also include sales commissions.

        Research and development.    Research and development, or R&D, expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including
share-based compensation for R&D personnel, and R&D work

47

Table of Contents

orders (that include material, direct labor and allocated overhead), as well as allocated development costs, such as engineering
services, software and hardware tools, depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We record all research and
development expense as incurred. Customers rely upon us to assist them with the development of new products and modiﬁcation
of existing products because of our extensive optical design and manufacturing expertise. We work closely with our customers in
the critical design phase of product development, and are often reimbursed for those development efforts. By virtue of our
overseas R&D operations and by focusing on customer-speciﬁc projects, our research and development expenses have tended to
represent a lower percentage of revenue compared to some of our competitors. In the future, we expect research and development
expense to increase on a dollar basis, but continue to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent our revenue increases over
time.

        Sales and marketing.    Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including stock based
compensation for our sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel and trade show expense, sales commissions and the
allocation of overall corporate services and facility costs. We sell our products to customers who either incorporate our products
into their offering or resell our products to end customers. Because we sell to a limited number of well-established customers, we
employ a limited number of sales professionals who are able to cover large markets. We compensate our sales staff through base
salary and commissions, with base salary being the largest component of overall compensation. Total sales commissions to
employees amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in 2013. Additionally, we pay commissions to third parties on
certain product lines and identiﬁed customers, which also amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in 2013. As such, our
sales and marketing expense does not directly increase with revenue. In the future, we expect sales and marketing expense to
increase on a dollar basis as we incrementally increase our overall sales activities, but expect our sales and marketing expense to
decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent our revenue increases over time.

        General and administrative.    General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-
based compensation, primarily for our ﬁnance, human resources and information technology personnel and certain executive
ofﬁcers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services,
depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in the short term,
as we develop the infrastructure necessary to operate as a public company, including increased audit and legal fees, costs to
comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national stock exchange,
as well as investor relations expense and higher insurance premiums. In the future, we expect general and administrative expense
to increase on a dollar basis but continue to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent our revenue increases over time.

Other income (expense)

        Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense
consists of amounts paid for interest on our short-term and long-term debt borrowings.

        Other income (expense), net is primarily made up of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The functional currency
of our China subsidiary is the RMB and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our China subsidiary primarily result
from their transactions in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of our Taiwan location is the NT dollar and the foreign

48

Table of Contents

currency transaction gains and losses of our Taiwan location primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars.

Income taxes

        We conduct our business globally. However, our operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the U.S., Taiwan and
China. Consequently, our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax
laws and regulations in each geographical region. We expect that our income taxes will vary in relation to our proﬁtability and the
geographic distribution of our proﬁts. Our effective U.S. federal income tax rate was 0% in the past three years as we have
incurred operating losses. At December 31, 2013, our U.S. accumulated net operating loss, or NOL, was $65.7 million. As we
earn proﬁts in the U.S., we expect to reduce our cash tax obligations by the utilization of NOL carry forwards. Our NOL beneﬁts
expire over the twelve-year period from 2020 to 2032. Under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership
change," the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs, capital loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to
offset its post-change income may be limited going forward. Based upon an analysis of our equity ownership, we have
experienced an ownership change and our NOL carry forwards are limited in dollar amount. As of December 31, 2013, of the
total accumulated NOL only $40.3 million is available for utilization in 2014 and thereafter to shelter federal taxable income.
Each year after 2014, an additional $0.3 million is added to the total available NOL, until a maximum of $43.9 million is reached.
The amount of NOL available each year may decrease by the amount of NOL utilized and may increase by the amount of any
operating losses incurred. Should we experience additional ownership changes our NOL carry forwards may be further limited.

        Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Technology, Inc., has enjoyed preferential tax concessions in China as a national high-
tech enterprise. In March 2007, China's parliament enacted the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, under which,
effective January 1, 2008, China adopted a uniform income tax rate of 25% for all enterprises including foreign invested
enterprises. Global Technology, Inc. was recognized as a national high-tech enterprise in 2008 and was entitled to a 15% tax rate
for a three year period from November 2008 to November 2011. In 2011, Global Technology, Inc. renewed its national high-tech
enterprise certiﬁcate and was therefore extended its three year tax preferential status from November 2011 to November 2014.

We prepare Adjusted EBITDA and our other non-GAAP measures to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our overall
operating performance. To arrive at our non-GAAP gross proﬁt, we exclude share-based compensation expense from our GAAP gross proﬁt. To arrive
at our non-GAAP income (loss) from operations we exclude all amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense and non-recurring
consulting fees, if any, from our GAAP net income (loss) from operations. To arrive at our Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude these same items and,
additionally, exclude asset impairment charges, loss (gain) from disposal of idle assets, unrealized

exchange loss (gain), interest (income) expense, on a net basis, provision for (beneﬁt from) income taxes and all depreciation expense from our GAAP
net income (loss).

We believe that our non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: 

•

•

•

•

We believe that elimination of items, such as share-based compensation expense, adjusted depreciation and amortization, income tax expense
and other income, net, is appropriate because treatment of these items may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance; 

We use non-GAAP measures in conjunction with our GAAP ﬁnancial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our
annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with
our board of directors concerning our ﬁnancial performance; 

We believe that non-GAAP measures provide better comparability with our past ﬁnancial performance, facilitates better period-to-period
comparisons of operational results and also facilitates comparisons with our peer companies, many of which also use similar non-GAAP
ﬁnancial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting; and 

We anticipate that, after consummating this offering, our investor presentations and those of securities analyst will include non-GAAP
measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. 

Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to gross proﬁt, income (loss) from operations, net income
(loss) or any other measure of ﬁnancial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP
measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or
such other non-GAAP measures in the same manner. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reason we consider them appropriate.
For a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP measures, see footnote 2 to the table in the section titled "Summary Consolidated Financial Data"
on page 7 of this prospectus.

        Of our total revenue in 2013, we generated $47.3 million, or 60.4%, from the CATV market, $19.3 million, or 24.7%, from
the internet data center market, $4.4 million, or 5.6%, from the FTTH market, and $7.3 million, or 9.3%, from other markets.
Total revenue increased by $15.0 million, or 23.7%, from 2012 to 2013.

        The increase in revenue was attributable to a $14.1 million increase from the internet data center market, and a $2.7 million
increase from other markets, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease from our CATV market. The increase in revenues in the
internet data center market were driven by increasing sales to customers we added late in 2012. The decline in revenues in the
CATV market in 2013 was a result of market-wide weakness, particularly in China, as well as delays in orders as a consequence
of mergers among several of our CATV customers.

associated with our increase in revenues. Within our markets, we sell similar products in different geographic regions at different
prices, resulting in different gross margins among our products. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of a higher

$8.5 million increase in direct material costs and a $1.3 million increase in labor and overhead costs, both of which were
associated with our increase in revenues. The increase in gross margin was caused by lower direct labor costs and lower overhead
from improved efﬁciency, combined with a reduction in our inventory reserve. The inventory reserves were higher in 2011
primarily due to discontinued products and aging of inventory on hand.

        Research and development expense increased by $1.2 million, or 17.9%, from 2011 to 2012, $0.7 million of which was
attributable to R&D material expenses associated with new product development. The remaining $0.5 million increase was a
result of a reallocation of existing personnel costs to R&D work orders and an increase in R&D stafﬁng. Because our R&D staff
is integral to new product development, our R&D staff often rotate between R&D work orders (non-production orders) and
production orders. As we shift those personnel from production back to R&D, our R&D expenses vary.

Sales and marketing expense

        Sales and marketing expense increased by $0.7 million, or 30.0%, from 2011 to 2012. This was due to a $0.5 million

General and administrative expense

        General and administrative expense decreased by $0.2 million, or 2.8%, from 2011 to 2012. This was primarily due to a
decrease in share based compensation expense because of the use of a reduced volatility assumption and prior grants becoming
fully vested.

        Total net other expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 29.5%, from 2011 to 2012. Interest expense remained relatively
unchanged from 2011 to 2012. While average loan balances increased from 2011 to 2012 by about $2.0 million, we beneﬁted
from a reduction in interest rates in 2012. The net other expense decreased by $0.5 million from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to
foreign currency revaluation gains from U.S. denominated accounts in 2012 when the NT dollar appreciated against the U.S.
dollar.

Quarterly revenue trends and seasonality

        Our quarterly results reﬂect seasonality in the sale of our products. Historically, our revenue has been highest in the fourth
quarter and lowest in the ﬁrst quarter. The ﬁrst quarter of the year has historically been negatively affected by reduced economic
activity due to the Chinese New Year holiday and the lower level of deployment of outdoor CATV equipment in cold weather
environments.

Quarterly gross margin trends

        Our gross margin varies quarter to quarter but has been within a range of 27.8% and 32.9% over the past eight quarters. Our
gross margin varies primarily due to the product mix in a

particular quarter, as well as from the level of manufacturing efﬁciencies, production yields (particularly in the laser chip
fabrication process) and overall supply costs.

Quarterly operating result trends

        Our quarterly operating results are likely to ﬂuctuate due to seasonality and other factors such as:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

general economic, industry and market conditions in our target markets; 

our CATV customers' willingness to outsource more of their internal design and manufacturing; 

changes in the mix of products within a quarter or changes in the volume of products sold within a particular
target market; 

our ability to obtain new orders, and the timing of such orders; 

the level of revenues from our orders; 

pricing policies by us or our competitors; 

our ability to fulﬁll sales orders in a timely manner within normal lead times or as otherwise demanded by
customers; 

our ability to adjust our production in response to quarter-over-quarter variations in revenue; 

our ability to adjust sales, general and administrative costs in response to changes in revenue; and 

our ability to control costs and capital expenditures.

        The occurrence of one or more of these factors could cause our revenue and corresponding operating results to vary widely.
As such, we believe that our quarterly levels of revenue and expenses may vary signiﬁcantly in the future, and that period-to-
period comparisons of our results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        From inception until our initial public offering, we ﬁnanced our operations through private sales of equity securities and
cash generated from operations and from various lending arrangements. On October 1, 2013, we completed our initial public
offering, in which we issued and sold 3,600,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $10.00 per share,
providing proceeds of $31.5 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. At December 31,
2013, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaled $30.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents
were held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds. We do not enter into investments for
trading or speculative purposes.

        In 2013, net cash used in operating activities was $6.6 million. Cash used in operating activities primarily related to an
increase in receivables from customers from the sale of our products in excess of cash paid to our suppliers. During the year
ended December 31, 2013, we recognized a net loss of $1.4 million. The net loss incorporated non-cash charges, including
depreciation and amortization of $3.4 million, share based compensation expenses of $1.1 million and non-cash increases to our
inventory reserve accounts of $0.5 million. We also spent $7.5 million to increase our inventories to support increases in sales
volumes, but this was offset by an increase in accounts payable.

        In 2012, net cash used in operating activities was $0.4 million. Cash used in operating activities primarily related to
payments to suppliers in excess of cash received from our customers from the sale of our products. During 2012, we recognized a
net loss of $0.9 million. However, that net loss incorporated non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of
$2.9 million, share-based compensation expense of $0.1 million and non-cash increases to our inventory reserve accounts of
$0.9 million. In addition, we spent $0.5 million in 2012 to increase our inventories in anticipation of expected increases in sales
volumes.

        In 2011, net cash used in operating activities was $4.1 million. Cash used in operating activities primarily related to
payments to suppliers in excess of cash received from our customers from the sale of our products. During 2011, we recognized a
net loss of $5.3 million. However, that net loss incorporated non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of
$3.1 million, share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million and non-cash increases to our inventory reserve accounts of
$1.6 million. In addition, we spent $1.6 million in 2011 to increase our inventories in anticipation of expected increases in sales
volumes.

Investing activities

        Our investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures and purchases of intangible assets.

        In 2013, we used $17.7 million of cash for investing activities, of which $9.3 million of cash was used for the purchase of
additional machinery and equipment to support our research and development efforts and manufacturing activities and
$8.0 million of cash was used for the purchase of short-term investments.

        In 2012, we used $3.3 million of cash for investing activities. We used $3.2 million of cash for the purchase of additional
machinery and equipment to support our research and

development efforts and manufacturing activities, partially offset by $0.1 million of cash provided by the sale of obsolete
equipment.

        In 2011, we used $1.6 million of cash for investing activities. We used $1.8 million of cash for the purchase of property and
equipment, partially offset by $0.4 million of cash provided by the sale of obsolete equipment.

Financing activities

        Our ﬁnancing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and preferred stock and activity
associated with our various lending arrangements.

        In 2013, our ﬁnancing activities provided $35.4 million in cash. We received $31.5 million in net proceeds from our initial
public offering. We received $3.5 million in net borrowings associated with our bank loans and received $0.7 million from the
exercise of stock options and warrants. These increases were offset by an increase in our restricted cash by $0.2 million, related
to the compensating balances required by our loans in China.

        In 2012, our ﬁnancing activities provided $12.8 million in cash. We received $10.2 million in cash from the issuance of
preferred stock, $2.7 million in net borrowings associated with our bank loans and $0.8 million from the issuance of notes
payable, offset in part by $0.7 million of payments of principal on our term loans and notes payable and $0.2 million to repay
loans from stockholders.

        In 2011, our ﬁnancing activities provided $2.8 million in cash, primarily resulting from $2.9 million of cash from the
issuance of preferred stock and $1.6 million in net borrowings associated with our bank loans, offset in part by $0.2 million of
payments of principal on our term loans and notes payable and $1.2 million to repay loans from stockholders.

Loans and commitments

        We have lending arrangements with several ﬁnancial institutions, including a loan and security agreement with East West
Bank in the U.S., several lines of credit arrangements for our China subsidiary and ﬁnancing agreements for our Taiwan location.

        As of December 31, 2013, our loan and security agreement in the U.S. included a $7.0 million revolving line of credit which
matures on November 15, 2015. Also included with the same bank is a term loan with monthly payments of principal and interest
that matures on November 15, 2014. As of December 31, 2013, we had $7.0 million outstanding under the revolving line of
credit and $3.1 million outstanding on the term loan.

        On September 10, 2013, our loan and security agreement in the U.S. was amended to add $5.0 million of borrowing
capability to the existing credit line, for the purpose of ﬁnancing equipment. The additional equipment term loan allows us to
draw up to the lesser of (i) $5.0 million, or (ii) 90% of the costs of equipment purchased between March 31, 2013 and March 10,
2014. Through March 10, 2014, we are required to pay interest only on the then-outstanding balance, and then pay equal
principal payments plus accrued interest monthly for the following 42 months. The interest rate for such equipment term loan is
the bank's prime lending rate plus 0.75%, currently a total of 4.0%. As of December 31 2013, $1.85 million has been drawn
against this equipment term loan.

61

Table of Contents

        Our loan and security agreement requires us to maintain certain ﬁnancial covenants, including a minimum current ratio,
maximum debt over net worth ratio and minimum debt service coverage. The agreement also restricts our minimum cash deposits
and the percentage of deposit with other banks. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in
this agreement.

        As of December 31, 2013, our China subsidiary had a line of credit facility and bank acceptances with China banks totaling
$18.0 million. As of December 31, 2013, a total of $12.1 million was outstanding under various notes, each with its own maturity
date and each renewing annually from January 2014 to August 2014. The notes that begin to mature in January 2014 are expected
to be renewed on the same terms and with new one year terms. These loans have renewed each year for the past three years.
While there can be no assurance of renewal as each loan matures, we expect these loans to renew this year as they have over the
past periods. On January 6, 2014, we paid off $4.5 million in loans with maturity dates ranging January 2014 to March 2014 to
China bank.

        As of December 31, 2013, our China subsidiary had a U.S. currency based loan of $2.4 million under various notes with
four month terms.

        In July 2013, our Taiwan location extended its outstanding note payable with a ﬁnancing company to mature on July 31,
2015.

        In December 2013, our Taiwan location entered into one year revolving Credit Facility Agreements with Taiwan banks for a
total of $8.0 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Our obligations under the
Credit Facility are secured by our $8.0 million cash deposit in a one-year CD with such banks. Borrowings under the Credit
Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the Taiwan Time Deposit Interest Rate Index plus 0.41%, which is currently 1.78%. As
of December 31, 2013, $3.8 million was outstanding under this credit facility.

        A customary business practice in China is for customers to exchange accounts receivable with notes receivable issued by
their bank. From time to time we accept notes receivable from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-
interest bearing and are generally due within six months, and such notes receivable may be redeemed with the issuing bank prior
to maturity at a discount. Historically, we have collected on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity.

        Frequently, we also direct our banking partners to issue notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts
payable. Our China subsidiary's banks issue the notes to vendors and issue payment to the vendors upon redemption. We owe the
payable balance to the issuing bank. The notes payable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within six months of
issuance. As a condition of the notes payable lending arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the
issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes payable balance until the notes payable are paid by our China subsidiary.
These balances are classiﬁed as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, our restricted cash
totaled $0.7 million.

Future liquidity needs

        We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash ﬂows from our operating activities,
will be sufﬁcient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 to 24 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on
many factors including our

62

Table of Contents

growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing
activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the costs to increase our manufacturing capacity and the continuing
market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional ﬁnancing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to
raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results
and ﬁnancial condition would be adversely affected.

We have several loan and security agreements in China, Taiwan and the U.S. that provide various credit facilities, including lines of credit
and term loans. The amount presented in the table represents the principal portion of the obligations. 

We have entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for our ofﬁces in Taiwan and the U.S. 

We are obligated to make payments under various arrangements with suppliers for the procurement of goods and services.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risks

        Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our ﬁnancial statements through adverse changes in ﬁnancial market
prices and rates and inﬂation. Our market risk exposure results primarily from ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and ﬁnancing activities. We have not historically
attempted to reduce our market risks through hedging instruments; we may, however, do so in the future.

Interest Rates

        We are exposed to interest rate ﬂuctuations on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We had unrestricted
cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 million, $10.7 million and $22.0 million at December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
Our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to limited interest rate risk and are primarily maintained in
money market funds and bank deposits.

        We have entered into various loan agreements with East West Bank in the U.S., China Construction Bank in China and
Mega Bank and Chailease Finance Co LTD in Taiwan. At December 31, 2013:

•

the revolving line of credit for our U.S.-based loans had a principal balance of $7.0 million, bearing interest at
rates based on the prime rate plus a premium of 0.5% or ﬂoor rate of 3.75% whichever is higher, maturing on
November 15, 2015,

our term loan with a U.S. bank had a principal balance of $3.1 million, with monthly payment of principal and
interest at prime rate plus 0.75% or ﬂoor rate 4%, maturing on November 15, 2014, 

our term loan with a U.S. bank had a principal balance of $1.9 million, interest payment only through March 10,
2014, and then equal principal and interest monthly installment payment for the following 42 months, maturing in
September 2017, 

the Chinese-based revolving line of credit loan had a principal balance of $7.1 million, bearing interest at
108%-110% of LIBOR or 6.48% to 6.6%, 

the Chinese-based revolving loan had a principal balance of $2.4 million, bearing interest at 4.1% to 4.15%, 

the Chinese bank acceptance notes issued to vendors had a balance of $2.3 million, bearing no interest rate, 

the Taiwanese-based revolving line of credit had a principal balance of $3.8 million, bearing interest at 1.78%,
maturing in December 2014, and 

the Taiwanese-based term loan had $0.9 million principal balance outstanding, with monthly payment of principal
and interest at interest rate of 4.95%, maturing on July 30, 2015.

        With respect to our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase or decrease of 1.0% in each of our
interest rates would have resulted in an increase of $0.3 million in our interest expense for such period.

Foreign Exchange Rates

        We operate on an international basis with a portion of our revenue and expenses being incurred in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in the value of these foreign currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the U.S. dollar
affects our results and will cause U.S. dollar translation of such currencies to vary from one period to another. We cannot predict
the effect of exchange rate ﬂuctuations upon our future operating results. The effect on our results of operations from currency
ﬂuctuations is reduced, however, because we have revenue and expenses in each of these foreign currencies.

        We maintain certain assets, including certain bank accounts, accounts receivables, land and building, in RMB and the NT
dollar, which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Additionally, certain of our current and long-term
liabilities are denominated in these currencies. As of December 31, 2013, ﬂuctuation in RMB and NT dollar currency exchange
rates resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in these currencies being translated into $0.5 million and $0.4 million more
U.S. dollars than at December 31, 2012, respectively.

        Additionally, the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies ﬂuctuates and is affected by, among other
things, changes in political and economic conditions in China. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S.
dollars, has been based on rates set by the People's Bank of China. On July 21, 2005, the Chinese government changed its policy
of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar and began allowing modest appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.
Fluctuation of the RMB exchange rate is, however, restricted to a rise or fall of no more than 0.5% per day versus the U.S. dollar,
and the People's Bank of China continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent signiﬁcant short-term

64

Table of Contents

ﬂuctuations in the RMB exchange rate. Nevertheless, under China's current exchange rate regime, the RMB may appreciate or
depreciate signiﬁcantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. The RMB has appreciated 8.46% against the
U.S. dollar from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013. There remains international pressure on the Chinese government to
adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more signiﬁcant appreciation in the
value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.

        We use the U.S. dollar as our functional and reporting currency for our ﬁnancial statements. All transactions in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar during the year are re-measured at the exchange rates prevailing on the respective relevant dates of such
transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities existing at the balance sheet date denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar
are re-measured at the exchange rates prevailing on such date. Exchange differences are recorded in our consolidated income
statement. The ﬁnancial records of our China subsidiary and our Taiwan location are maintained in their respective local
currencies, the RMB and the NT dollar, which are the functional currencies for our China subsidiary and our Taiwan location,
respectively. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at
historical exchange rates and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average annual rate in 2011, a quarterly
average rate in 2012 and a monthly average rate in 2013. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation
adjustments and are shown as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of
stockholders' equity (deﬁcit) and comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in our statements of
operations in other income (expenses).

        We incurred approximately 49.4% of our operating expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar during 2013. As of
December 31, 2013, we held the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $14.3 million in RMB and $0.1 million in NT dollars,
included in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Fluctuations in exchange rates directly affect our cost of revenues
and net income, and have a signiﬁcant impact on ﬂuctuations in our operating margins. For example, in 2013, 92.2% of our
revenues were generated from sales denominated in U.S. dollars, and 21.4% of our operating costs and expenses were
denominated in RMB and 28.0% of our operating costs were denominated in NT dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates also
affect our balance sheet. For example, if we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB or NT dollars for our operations, appreciation
of the RMB or the NT dollar against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB or NT dollar amount that we
receive from the conversion. With respect to our total cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2013, a 1.0% change
in the exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar would result in a $0.1 million change in our total cash and short-term
investments, and a 1.0% change in the exchange rates between the NT dollar and the U.S. dollar would result in an immaterial
change in our total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

        Fluctuations in currency exchange rates of the above currencies we hold against the U.S. dollar would have a corresponding
impact on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such currencies included in the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
reported in our ﬁnancial statements from period to period.

Inﬂation

        We believe that the relatively low rate of inﬂation in the U.S. over the past few years has not had a signiﬁcant impact on our
sales or operating results or on the prices of raw materials. To the extent we expand our operations in China and Taiwan, such
actions may result in inﬂation having a more signiﬁcant impact on our operating results in the future.

65

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

        During 2011, 2012 and 2013, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or ﬁnancial partnerships,
such as structured ﬁnance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

        Our discussion and analysis of our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash ﬂows, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation expense,
impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, warranty liabilities and accounting for income
taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these
estimates and our actual results, our future ﬁnancial statements will be affected.

        We believe that of our signiﬁcant accounting policies, which are described in Note B to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements
appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our ﬁnancial condition and results of
operations.

Revenue recognition

        We generally employ a direct sales model in North America, and in the rest of the world we use both direct and indirect
channels. Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize gross revenue whether our products are sold on a direct or indirect basis,
because our reseller customers (indirect channel) take title to our products and honor the same terms and conditions as do our
direct sales customers. We recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the price is ﬁxed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Contracts or customer
purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when
applicable, are used to verify delivery. We assess whether the price is ﬁxed or determinable based on the payment terms
associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectability based
primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer's payment history. Customers
are generally extended net 30 credit terms from the date of shipment, with some extension to net 60 credit terms for some more
creditworthy customers.

        Whether our products are sold on a direct or indirect basis, revenue is recognized when the product is shipped and title has
transferred to the customer. We bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms
of sale provide that title passes to the customer upon placement by us with a common carrier (upon shipment). In some cases we
may provide for title transfer to the customer upon delivery of the goods to the customer. We determine payments made to third
party sales representatives are appropriately recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue. Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. We present revenue net of sales returns and allowances, sales taxes and any
similar assessments. We provided a limited warranty as part of our standard

66

Table of Contents

terms and conditions of sale. This warranty provides for the repair or replacement of our products, at our discretion, that we
determined (i) are defective in workmanship, material, or not in compliance with the mutually agreed written applicable
speciﬁcation and (ii) has in fact failed under normal use on or before one year from the date of original shipment of the products.
Some of our customers are provided limited warranties between three to ﬁve years, on certain limited and identiﬁed products.
Warranty costs associated with returned goods that are repaired or replaced are charged to cost of goods sold.

        During our ordinary course of business, we may enter into new product development agreements to design, customize and
develop new products for our customers. Such new product development agreements often involve material cost and engineering
hours and therefore non-recurring engineering service (NRE) charges are agreed upon for the customer to reimburse our related
costs. We adopt the percentage-of-completion method in revenue recognition for NRE revenues by using cost-input
measurement. We capitalize cost input up to the contractual agreement amount and recognize NRE revenues based upon the
agreement schedule. Contracts or customer purchase orders are often used to determine the existence of a service agreement.

Share-Based Compensation

        Stock option fair value is calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The compensation cost is
then recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the option, which is generally the option vesting term
of four years. The Black-Scholes valuation model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected term, volatility,
dividend yield and risk-free interest rates that determine the stock option fair value. In addition, we estimate forfeitures at the
time of grant. As there had been no market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering, the expected volatility for
options granted to date was derived from an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with
similar terms. The expected volatility has been determined using an average of the expected volatility reported by this peer group
of companies. We use a risk free interest rate based on the 10-year Treasury as reported during the period. The expected term of
the options has been determined utilizing the simpliﬁed method which calculates a simple average based on vesting period and
option life. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. Estimated forfeitures are based on historical experience and
future work force projections.

Long-lived assets

        Depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long-lived assets is provided using the straight-line method
over their respective estimated useful lives, reﬂecting the pattern of economic beneﬁts associated with these assets. Changes in
circumstances such as technological advances, changes to our business model, or changes in our capital strategy could cause the
actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long-lived assets to differ from initial estimates. In those cases where we
determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised, we depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated
useful life.

        Our long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We value on an asset-by-asset basis our long-lived assets and will recognize an
impairment loss when the sum of such valuation is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The values, based on reasonable
and supportable assumptions and projections, require subjective judgments. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used,
the values projected in the evaluation of long-lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes. We consider the likelihood of
possible outcomes in determining the best estimate for the value of the assets. We did not record any asset impairment charges in
2013 or 2012.

67

Valuation of inventories

        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average-cost method) or market. Work in process and ﬁnished goods includes
materials, labor and allocated overhead. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and provide an allowance
for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future demand. During the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded excess and obsolete inventory charges of $0.5 million, $0.9 million, and
$1.6 million, respectively. Of the $1.6 million in inventory reserves during 2011, $1.0 million was recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2011 and was associated with the application of our inventory reserve policy.

        During 2011, we reviewed our inventory policy to determine if the existing reserve for obsolescence and loss was
appropriate. The policy at the time provided reserves on a schedule that weighted inventory over a two year period, but the
maximum reserve was 80% of inventory value, regardless of the age of inventory. We modiﬁed the policy to account for more
distinct periods, and to fully reserve any inventory that was over two years old. The policy provides for aging of inventory as
follows:

•

•

•

•

Less than 360 days—10% 

Between 360 and 540 days—50% 

Between 540 and 720—80% 

Over 720 days—100%

        We considered the following factors in our determination of the appropriate reserve level: how often we buy material in bulk
that lasts for more than 12 months of supply; changes in material costs over a 24 month period; the overall market value of raw
material, semi-ﬁnished goods and ﬁnished goods across our varied product lines and within markets; changes in expected demand
for our products; the change in valuations historically; the determined safety stock for key customers; and the likelihood of
postponement in delivery schedules for materials already placed in ﬁnished goods inventory.

Accounting for income taxes

        We account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. The liability method is used to
account for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted
tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is
evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future
beneﬁts in our tax returns.

Overview

BUSINESS 

        We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of ﬁber-optic networking products. We target three networking end-markets:
CATV, FTTH and internet data center. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels
of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing products for our
customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we
design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers' needs and speciﬁcations, and such products differ from
each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher performance
segments within the CATV, FTTH and internet data center markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity and
innovation.

        In 2013, our revenue was $78.4 million and our gross margin was 29.4%. We have grown our annual revenue at a CAGR of
33.1% between 2009 and 2013. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, we incurred losses of $5.3 million,
$0.9 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, and our accumulated deﬁcit at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 was
$81.9 million and $83.3 million, respectively. In 2013, we earned 60.4% of our total revenue from the CATV market, and 24.7%
of our total revenue from the data center market. In 2013, our key customers in the CATV market included Cisco Systems and
Biogenomics Corp., a distributor. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, Cisco Systems accounted for 26.8%, 33.2%, and 21.8%, respectively,
of our revenue and Biogenomics Corp. accounted for 11.7%, 11.2% and 8.7%, respectively, of our revenue. In 2013, our key
customers in the data center market included Amazon and Microsoft. In 2012 and 2013, Amazon accounted for 5.8% and 18.2%
of our revenue, respectively, and Microsoft accounted for 2.6% and 6.1% of our revenue, respectively.

        The three end markets we target are all driven by signiﬁcant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected
devices, video trafﬁc, cloud computing and online social networking. According to Cisco Systems' 2013 Visual Networking
Index, global network trafﬁc is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 23% from 2012 to 2017. To address this
increased bandwidth demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by
providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity and capability of
their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reﬂected in the shift to
higher speed server connections. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, 10 gigabit ethernet enterprise port shipments in 2012
were 14.7 million and are projected to grow to 109.4 million in 2017, representing a 49.3% CAGR. As a result of these trends,
ﬁber-optic networking technology is becoming essential in all three of our target markets, as it is often the only economic way to
deliver the required bandwidth.

        The CATV market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including
lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed signiﬁcantly to
our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of CATV equipment vendors who have begun to outsource
both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While these equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble
products for some time, only recently have they started to shift the design of equipment to other parties due in part to the
sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed-signal
semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to beneﬁt from it.

Table of Contents

        Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast
response times to customer requests and better control over product quality and manufacturing costs. We design, manufacture and
integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary MBE fabrication process, which we believe is unique in our
industry. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our products. The lasers we
manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity, making them well-
suited to the CATV and FTTH markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors. We believe the superior
performance of our lasers is evidenced by our leading share of lasers installed in CATV networks today.

        We are based in Sugar Land, Texas, where we design and fabricate our lasers, and conduct most of our research and
development efforts. At our facilities in Ningbo, China, and Taipei, Taiwan, we complete the assembly of our lasers and
photodiodes and also design and assemble our module and equipment products, utilizing a combination of advanced automation
and skilled labor. In addition to our global sales team in the U.S., we also have regional sales teams located in China and Taiwan.

        In 2013, our revenue was $78.4 million and our gross margin was 29.4%. We have grown our annual revenue at a CAGR of
33.1% between 2009 and 2013. In the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, we incurred losses of $5.3 million,
$0.9 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, and our accumulated deﬁcit at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 was
$81.9 million and $83.3 million, respectively.

Industry Background

        Our three target markets of CATV, FTTH and internet data centers share a common trend of a signiﬁcant growth in
bandwidth consumption, and the corresponding need for network infrastructure improvement to support it. Within the CATV and
FTTH markets, the speed of a broadband connection determines the types and quality of services that can be offered, and
competitive pressure among service providers is spurring ever faster broadband connectivity. According to the Akamai State of
the Internet report for the third quarter of 2013, the number of 10 megabit or faster broadband connections in the U.S. rose 82%
year-over-year. Akamai reported that, globally, the average connection speed increased 29% over the prior year, including growth
in all of the top 10 countries.

        Government encouragement and sponsorship of enhanced broadband service is contributing to investment in access
networks. For instance, in January 2013, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced the "Gigabit City
Challenge," setting a goal of at least one community per state with 1 gigabit per second broadband by 2015. Similarly, according
to Infonetics, China's State Agency for Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT) announced a $30 billion Next Generation
Broadband (NGB) stimulus program in 2009 to support the construction of critical networking infrastructure and promote the
delivery of enhanced voice, video and data services between 2009 and 2015.

        The commercial opportunity to provide ultra-high speed broadband services is also attracting private sector interest. For
example, in 2010 Google announced plans to build a network, known as Google Fiber, to deliver up to 1 gigabit per second
service to residences, approximately 100 times faster than the current average peak rate in the U.S. The network became
operative late in 2012 in Kansas City. Google has announced that they plan to begin deploying Google Fiber in Austin, Texas in
2014 and it is in discussions with government ofﬁcials in 34 additional cities to expand Google Fiber in these communities. We
are not aware of our products currently being used in the Kansas City network and Google has not publicly

70

Table of Contents

announced the technology or the vendors it is using for the other cities. To deliver this dramatically greater bandwidth, Google is
utilizing very advanced optical networking technology. The Google Fiber network demonstrates the ability to deliver
dramatically more bandwidth to an end user, and may prompt traditional network service providers to accelerate investment in
advanced optical networking solutions.

        Based upon data prepared by Ovum, we estimate that our addressable segments of the CATV, FTTH and internet data center
markets represented an annual revenue opportunity of $2.2 billion in 2012.

Trends in the CATV Market

        CATV service providers have been upgrading their hybrid ﬁber coaxial networks, which use a combination of optical ﬁber
and coaxial cable, to support high speed, two-way communications. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, CATV service
providers have spent approximately $40 billion from 2008 through 2012 on upgrades and extensions to their networking
infrastructure, including $24 billion spent in North America. Broadcast video services remain the primary offering for CATV
service providers, who compete in part on the breadth of high deﬁnition, or HD, TV content and on-demand programming they
offer. CATV network operators can leverage an upgraded network to deliver additional services such as enhanced voice and
broadband connectivity. Enhanced broadcast video and data connectivity services have had a profound effect on CATV network
architecture, as they require substantially greater bandwidth to a home (the "forward path"), and two-way communications
(introducing a "return path" from the home). In a 2013 report, Infonetics estimated that 53 million broadband subscribers in North
America, or 54% of total North American broadband subscribers, received their service through a CATV network at the end of
2012.

        Outside of the U.S., the opportunity for CATV growth is signiﬁcant. For instance, China's installed cable infrastructure is
signiﬁcantly larger than that of the U.S., with over 200 million cable television subscribers. Nearly half of China's cable
television subscribers are served by relatively low capacity, one-way cable networks today, and China has implemented a
government stimulus program to upgrade broadband infrastructure. As a result, we believe that the Chinese CATV service
providers will invest signiﬁcantly in coming years.

        Consolidation among CATV equipment companies has continued in recent years (including the recent announcement by
Comcast that it will acquire Time Warner), putting pressure on the largest companies to streamline their operations, improve
proﬁtability and focus their resources. In response, many of these CATV equipment companies have begun to outsource not only
the manufacturing of equipment, but more important to us, they have begun to outsource the system design function as well.
Outsourcing of system design is signiﬁcantly more challenging than simply shifting the assembly of equipment to a third party
manufacturer. The complex interworking of optical, radio frequency and electrical technologies, as well as the physical
challenges imposed by the harsh and unregulated conditions in which the CATV equipment is installed, requires deep technical
knowledge of high-speed optical, mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering. Field failure of equipment is costly
and problematic for CATV network operators, so they expect equipment providers to provide extremely reliable and durable
solutions. As a result, the decision by a major CATV equipment company to outsource design and manufacture to a third party is
made carefully, and once an outsourced design partner is selected, CATV equipment companies are typically very reluctant to
change vendors. Moreover, once the design function is outsourced to a third party, the reallocation of internal resources
previously performing that function makes it difﬁcult for the equipment company to return to internally designing equipment.

71

        Based upon data prepared by Ovum, we estimate that our addressable segment of the CATV market represented an annual
revenue opportunity of $850 million in 2012.

Trends in the FTTH Market

        The FTTH market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that telecommunications service providers are
deploying. PONs take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user
over a shared ﬁber-optic cable from a service provider's central ofﬁce. The equipment in the service provider's central ofﬁce is
called an optical line terminal, or OLT, and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit, or ONU. A PON supports
signiﬁcantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network, although the connection speed to a user (the
"downstream" speed) is higher than the connection speed from the user (the "upstream" speed). In the U.S., Verizon's FIOS
service and AT&T's uVerse offering are examples of PON deployments, and PONs have been widely deployed in Japan, Korea
and selected cities in Europe as well. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, worldwide FTTH subscribers are expected to grow
from 57 million in 2012 to 149 million in 2017, representing a CAGR of 21%, with the growth of higher speed FTTH
connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of FTTH connectivity.

        Over time, the technology used in PONs has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users. At present, the
most commonly deployed PON technology is GPON, or Gigabit PON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data
downstream, split among subscribers, and 1.5 gigabits per second upstream. Due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple
users—often as many as 32—the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the 2.5 gigabits per
second supported by the GPON equipment. To deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber, a service provider can reduce the split
ratio or change the PON technology. Reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single OLT may be less expensive for
modest, incremental upgrades, but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the signiﬁcant increases in bandwidth
needed to support 1 gigabit per second service to the home, as encouraged by the FCC's Gigabit Challenge.

        One approach that does support 1 gigabit per second service to the home connection is WDM-PON, or wavelength division
multiplexing PON. Well-proven in other areas of the network for decades, WDM technology enables the transmission of multiple
wavelengths of data over a single ﬁber-optic strand, thus signiﬁcantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical ﬁber connection.
Due to this signiﬁcant increase in bandwidth supported with WDM-PON, the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than
that for GPON—at faster connection speeds. In addition to providing more bandwidth, WDM-PON offers a subscriber superior
privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one.

        Based upon data prepared by Ovum, we estimate that our addressable segment of the FTTH market represented an annual
revenue opportunity of $704 million in 2012.

Trends in the Internet Data Center Market

        An internet data center is structured in a layered format, with rows of servers within multiple racks, and each server and rack
connecting through a switch. These rack switches then connect to each other, and ultimately to the service provider's network.
The connections between these top-of-rack switches, and to the service provider's network, are increasingly done with higher-
capacity optical networking technology. Legacy copper cables can carry signals at distances adequate to meet most needs within
an enterprise or internet data center at speeds up

72

Table of Contents

to about 1 gigabit per second. However, at speeds of 10 gigabits per second and above, the signals sent over copper cables
experience increasing attenuation and dispersion over distances common in large internet data center environments, making
copper much less effective as a transmission medium. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, 10 gigabit ethernet enterprise port
shipments in 2012 were 14.7 million and are projected to grow to 109.4 million in 2017, representing a 49.3% CAGR.

        In recent years, a number of leading internet companies have begun to adopt more open internet data center architectures,
using a mix of systems and components from a variety of vendors, and in some cases designing their own equipment. For
companies that are adopting open internet data center architectures, compatibility of new networking equipment with legacy
infrastructure is not as important, and as a consequence, these companies are more willing to work with non-traditional
equipment vendors. Non-traditional equipment vendors generally permit companies to source optical modules from any vendor,
thus creating an open and growing opportunity for optical device vendors.

        Based upon data prepared by research ﬁrm Ovum, we estimate that our addressable segment of the internet data center
market represented an annual revenue opportunity of $638 million in 2012.

Key Challenges in Our Markets

        The key challenges that we experience in our markets include:

•

•

•

•

Continuous pressure for innovation.  To enhance their competitiveness and improve the ﬁnancial returns on their
infrastructure investments, CATV and FTTH network operators seek to regularly introduce new service offerings,
increase the bandwidth provided to each user and reduce their operating costs. These operators work with their
equipment and optical device suppliers to develop innovative technology that enables desired enhancements.
Within the internet data center market, industry-leading technology companies are internally designing and
developing internet data centers to deliver cloud-based solutions. These companies are, in many cases, working
with third parties to design custom data-center equipment to improve their internet data center performance and
differentiate their services from other vendors. 

Demand for highly integrated solutions.  CATV and FTTH network operators are seeking integrated and
customized solutions that meet speciﬁc design and performance requirements. Furthermore, network equipment
manufacturers are seeking to simplify their supply chains and lower their costs by working with optical device
vendors who can provide a broad range of products, including integrated modules and subsystems rather than
simply supplying discrete optical components. 

Need for reliable performance in harsh and demanding environments.  Unlike optical devices deployed in the
long haul and metro segments of the telecom network, optical devices deployed in CATV and FTTH networks are
typically installed outdoors, and occasionally in remote locations. As a result, these devices are subject to a wide
range of temperatures and highly variable environmental conditions, and maintenance can be difﬁcult. As a result
of the difﬁculties associated with outdoor deployment, product quality and reliability are essential. 

Demand for production of high-quality devices in large volumes.  Due to the high number of optical devices
deployed in CATV and FTTH networks as well as in internet

73

Table of Contents

data centers, network equipment manufacturers seek vendors that can provide cost-effective and high-quality
optical devices in large volumes. As the required bandwidth in CATV and FTTH networks increases and the shift
to ﬁber-optic technologies continues in order to meet the bandwidth needs, the number of optical devices
deployed in CATV and FTTH networks should continue to increase.

•

Need for mixed signal communications expertise.  As CATV network operators continue to shift from primarily
broadcast-video content providers to data-connectivity providers, the networks they utilize to offer these services
are evolving. For example, many newer networks are being designed with digital return-path capabilities. In this
type of network, signals traveling from the cable ofﬁce headend to the user residence, including digital video and
data services, continue to be transported as analog signals, whereas signals traveling in the opposite direction,
from the residence to the cable ofﬁce headend, may now be carried as digital signals. This combination of analog
and digital signaling creates unique challenges, which require high-performance networking equipment and
optical technology.

Our Solutions

        We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of ﬁber-optic networking products. We are primarily focused on the higher-
performance segments within the CATV, FTTH and internet data center markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity
and new technologies. Our products include a broad range of optical communications-based products at varying levels of
integration from components to complete turn-key systems that we design and manufacture for leading networking equipment
companies. The key beneﬁts of our products include:

•

•

•

more dependable, cost-effective and simpliﬁed supply chain. By leveraging our vertical integration, proprietary
expertise and our broad range of products, we can often design and manufacture new solutions rapidly and cost-
effectively for our customers. For example, our integration capabilities have enabled us to beneﬁt from the trend
of outsourced design and manufacturing among CATV equipment vendors.

and maintain quality control throughout the production process, using our internally produced components where
possible for our ﬁnal products. By leveraging this greater degree of control throughout the entire production
process, our proprietary MBE laser fabrication process and packaging technology, and our extensive facilities, we
are able to deliver high-quality, highly-reliable and stable products in high volume.

74

Table of Contents

•

Provide sophisticated design solutions to our customers.  We believe our expertise in analog and digital optical
engineering, as well as radio frequency and high-speed electronics differentiates us from many competitors, as
other vendors tend to focus on a limited number of these disciplines. Our mixed-signal expertise enables us to
design solutions that meet many of the different network architectures and protocols used today. We offer our
customers an advantage by providing them a comprehensive solution.

Our Strengths

        Our key competitive strengths include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

Industry-leading position in the CATV market.  We are the leading provider of optical components and the
second largest provider of subsystems to the CATV market, according to Ovum. In 2013, our products were used
by the three largest CATV OEMs, consisting of Cisco Systems, Inc., Arris Group Inc. (which acquired the
Motorola Home Business in 2013) and Aurora Networks (a subsidiary of Pace plc (which acquired the Harmonic
optical business in 2013) and was subsequently itself acquired by Pace plc). These OEMs are extremely
demanding on their suppliers with respect to product performance, reliability, cost and vendor service level. We
believe these customer relationships beneﬁt us with other customers who view our selection by these leading
OEMs as validation of our expertise and product excellence. 

Proprietary technological expertise and track record of innovation.  We continue to develop innovative products
as evidenced by our design wins since the beginning of 2010. We believe our proprietary laser manufacturing, or
MBE process, allows us to produce more reliable and cost-effective solutions than our competitors who typically
employ MOCVD processes. We own fundamental intellectual property in MBE technology and other laser design
and manufacturing processes. We had 113 U.S. and foreign issued patents as of December 31, 2013. In addition
we have amassed substantial manufacturing, process, design and testing domain expertise that we retain as
documented trade secrets. 

Highly customized products.  Most of our products have some level of customization, and in some cases our
product is the only one that can meet our customers' speciﬁcations. These factors make it more difﬁcult for our
customers to rapidly switch to another supplier, and, we believe, contribute to longer product lifecycles and more
stable product pricing relative to the pricing trends experienced in many telecommunications optical component
categories. 

Proven system design capabilities.  Our customers rely on us to design their customized, complex and integrated
equipment due to our deep expertise in high-speed optical, mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical
engineering. As a result of these capabilities, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of the
continuing shift to outsourced design and manufacturing among CATV equipment vendors. 

Vertically integrated, geographically distributed manufacturing model.  Our vertically integrated design and
manufacturing process encompasses all steps from laser wafer design and fabrication to complete optical system
design and assembly. Furthermore, we have geographically distributed our manufacturing model by strategically
locating our operations in the U.S., China and Taiwan to reduce development time and production costs and to
help protect our intellectual property. Our comprehensive capabilities allow us to offer our customers a
dependable supply of quality optical components, modules

75

Table of Contents

and equipment. Additionally, similar to other competitors who have a vertically-integrated structure, these
capabilities give us signiﬁcant time-to-market, time-to-volume and cost advantages as well as the ability to
respond more rapidly to changing market and customer requirements. Furthermore, these capabilities allow us to
provide fully integrated solutions and capture a larger portion of the bill of materials within the optical value
chain.

Our Strategy

        We seek to be the leading global provider of optical components, modules and equipment designed for each of our three
target markets, CATV, FTTH and internet data centers. All of our target markets are growing due to the increasing demand for
bandwidth, but each of our markets is also being driven by independent factors. As a result, our overall growth is not dependent
upon a single market or a single trend. Our strategy includes the following key elements:

•

•

•

•

Extend our leadership in CATV networking.  We intend to maintain our position as the leading producer of
optical components used in CATV networks, and to capture an increasing share of the CATV equipment market as
the major equipment vendors continue to outsource the design and manufacturing of such products. We believe
that our comprehensive design expertise, proven ability to handle increased system-level responsibility and
vertically integrated manufacturing model position us well to capture a meaningful share of this opportunity. 

Continue to penetrate the FTTH market.  We believe our WDM-PON technology is a cost-effective solution for
delivering substantially greater bandwidth to a residence. As the residential access market migrates to higher
bandwidth connections, we expect that our solutions will become increasingly attractive. Moreover, we are
expanding our product offerings for the FTTH market to increase the portion of the market we can address. Our
initial WDM-PON products addressed the network operator side of the link between residences and the network
operator, and we have recently introduced solutions for the customer premise side of the link. 

Continue to penetrate the internet data center market.  To date, we have targeted internet data center operators
directly, particularly those who have adopted an open system architecture in which the optical connectivity
solutions can be provided by a different vendor than the vendor which provides their servers and switches. We
believe this segment of the market will grow meaningfully in coming years, and that we are well positioned to
capture this business as an independent optics vendor. Additionally, we are expanding our sales efforts to leading
network equipment vendors who sell into the internet data center as well as large scale enterprise markets. 

Continue to invest in our capabilities and infrastructure.  Product and process innovations have been important
elements in our growth and commercial success. For instance, our leading position in the CATV market is a result
of our research and development efforts to address the need for climate-tolerant, low-cost and highly reliable
lasers, components and equipment. We believe our vertically integrated manufacturing model and our ability to
design and manufacture the fundamental optical devices that are deployed throughout a network give us a
signiﬁcant competitive advantage. We intend to continue to invest in new products, new technology and our
production infrastructure and facilities to maintain and strengthen our competitive position.

•

Selectively pursue other opportunities that leverage our existing expertise.  The proven performance of our
lasers in harsh climate conditions and our expertise in designing and manufacturing outdoor plant equipment for
the CATV industry provide us an advantage in pursuing applications that are also characterized by having varying
and demanding environments. We have sold and plan to continue to sell products into the telecom networking
market, such as for wireless and wireline telecom infrastructure. We have also selectively sold products into the
industrial robotics, aerospace and defense, and oil and gas exploration markets. We will continue to seek ways to
capitalize on our research and development investments and leverage our high-speed optical, mixed-signal
semiconductor and mechanical engineering expertise in these and other markets. 

Pursue complementary acquisition and strategic alliance opportunities.  While we prefer to use our components
whenever possible, we will evaluate and selectively pursue acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances that we
believe will enhance or complement our current product offerings, augment our technology roadmap, or diversify
our revenue base.

Technology

        We believe that we have technology leadership in four key areas: semiconductor laser manufacturing, electronic
technologies that enhance the performance of our lasers, optical hybrid integration and mixed-signal semiconductor design.

•

•

•

Differentiated semiconductor laser manufacturing.  We use a MBE fabrication process to make our lasers, rather
than MOCVD, the technique most commonly used in optical chip manufacturing by traditional communications
optics vendors. Among the differentiators of MBE relative to MOCVD fabrication are a lower process
temperature and the use of solid phase materials rather than gaseous sources to grow wafers and the growth of
more highly strained crystals. These factors contribute to longer operating lives of our lasers, improved laser
efﬁciency and threshold current, among other performance attributes that make them well-suited to our target
markets. While we believe that these advantages of MBE are important, MBE does have disadvantages including
the inability to use certain dopant materials (for example Iron), difﬁculty in certain types of regrowth, and the
necessity to maintain complex ultra-high vacuum equipment. As a result of some of these challenges, production
yields, and the performance attributes of laser devices, are highly variable and optimizing these characteristics
requires numerous enhancements and modiﬁcations to standard MBE equipment and the MBE process. To our
knowledge, we are unique in using an MBE process to produce communications lasers in high volume, and
believe it would be difﬁcult, and time-consuming, for other vendors to replicate our production technology. 

Laser enhancement technology.  Certain properties of the semiconductor lasers predominantly used in traditional
communications devices, such as chirp and wavelength drift, negatively affect their ability to transmit signals over
long ﬁber distances or prevent them from transmitting signals with acceptable ﬁdelity in certain applications. We
have developed laser enhancement circuitry that can correct many of these deﬁciencies. We believe that our
technology will become more essential with wider deployment of higher capacity CATV and FTTH systems,
which place more stringent demands on laser performance. 

Optical hybrid-integration technology.  Reducing the size, power consumption and complexity of optical devices
is essential for achieving the price and performance targets

77

Table of Contents

of our customers. Our ability to integrate multiple optical networking functions into a single device, and to co-
package multiple devices into smaller form factors helps us meet customer requirements and we believe can also
create new opportunities. For instance, installing new ﬁber-optic cable is expensive and difﬁcult, and in some
situations prohibitively so for a network service provider. As a consequence, network operators seek to maximize
the utilization of their installed ﬁber plant. In long-haul and metropolitan networks, service providers deployed
WDM technology as ﬁber utilization rose. Fiber utilization in access networks is rising, but the use of WDM
technology in the access segment has been problematic due to the relatively high cost and power consumption of
the requisite optical devices. We have developed proprietary miniaturized optical packaging, electronic control
circuitry and testing algorithms to create a hybrid WDM-PON solution that addresses these historical
impediments that we believe will make WDM-PON a cost-effective alternative for deployment. 
WDM-PON is a term used for a variety of multi-wavelength PON architectures. Various technologies have been
utilized by several companies to deploy WDM-PON networks in the past. These existing technologies are
generally believed to be too costly to deploy or suffer from operational limitations that limit their use to only
certain deployment scenarios. By contrast, we believe our optical hybrid-integration technology can be deployed
in a wide range of circumstances due to its lower cost per bit delivered, and as the market migrates to higher
bandwidth connections we expect that our solutions will become increasingly attractive. In the internet data center
market, we target operators who have adopted an open system architecture—one in which the optical connectivity
solutions can be provided by a different vendor than the vendor which provides their servers and switches. We
believe this segment of the market will grow meaningfully in coming years, and that we are well positioned to
capture this business as an independent optics vendor.

Mixed-signal design.  As CATV providers continue to evolve from primarily broadcast-video content providers to
a mixture of HD video content together with data-connectivity providers, the networks they utilize to offer these
services must evolve as well. Older analog networks are giving way to hybrid networks that incorporate both
analog and digital signals. For example, many newer networks are being designed with "digital return-path"
capabilities. In this type of network, signals traveling from the headend to the residence are transported as analog
signals, whereas signals traveling in the opposite direction (that is, originating at the residence and being
transmitted towards the headend) are carried as digital signals. This combination of analog and digital signaling
creates unique design challenges. Our engineers have many years of experience in developing equipment,
modules and components that are well suited to these sorts of mixed-signal architectures. We believe that having
deep experience in both digital and analog signaling allows us to offer superior solutions to our customers,
compared with companies who have expertise in only one of these signal types.

Our Products

        Our products include an array of optical communications solutions at varying levels of integration. We begin from the
fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a
wide range of products from optical modules to complete turn-key equipment. We design our products to target customers in our
identiﬁed markets to meet their needs and speciﬁcations.

Table of Contents

        Our components often incorporate one or more of our optical laser chips inside a precision housing that provides mechanical
protection as well as standardized electrical contacts. More complex optical components may also include optical ﬁlters (for
example, for use in WDM) or other optical elements by which optical signals are routed internally within the component. These
more advanced components may also include coolers, heaters and sensors that allow the temperature of the laser chip to be
measured and controlled. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our own
products.

        At the next level of integration, our module or sub-assembly products typically contain one or more of our optical
components and some additional control circuitry. Examples of modules include our transceiver line primarily used in internet
data center markets and FTTH markets.

        At the highest level of integration and complexity, our equipment products typically contain one or more optical
components, modules and additional electronic control circuitry required to enable these subsystems to operate independently.
For example, our CATV transmitter equipment requires utilization of our optical components and assembly onto a circuit board
and to an external housing. Examples of equipment include our CATV transmitter and CATV nodes.

        Our products mainly differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We have over 10,600
product stock-keeping units, or SKUs, including approximately 4,600 component product SKUs, approximately 3,500 module
product SKUs and approximately 2,600 equipment product SKUs. The following tables provide a view of our some of our
various components, modules and equipment grouped by the markets they serve.

Intellectual Property

        We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as conﬁdentiality and licensing
arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We employ various methods to protect these intellectual property
rights, including maintaining a technological infrastructure with signiﬁcant security measures, limiting disclosure and restricting
access to only those individuals with an operational need for such information, and having employees, consultants and suppliers
execute conﬁdentiality agreements with us. While we expect our intellectual property to provide competitive advantages, we also
ﬁnd meaningful value from unpatented proprietary process knowledge, know-how and trade secrets.

Patents

        As of December 31, 2013, we owned a total of 113 U.S. and foreign issued patents, 58 of which were issued in the U.S. and
55 of which were issued in China and Taiwan. Our issued patents will expire between 2018 and 2028.

        Our portfolio of patents and patent applications covers several different technology families including:

Trademarks

        We have registered the trademarks APPLIED OPTOELECTRONICS, INC., AOI and our logo with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Ofﬁce on the Principal Register. These marks are also registered in, or have applications for registration pending in,
various foreign trademark ofﬁces. A U.S. trademark registration is also pending for the mark "AAOI."

Research and Development

        To maintain our growth and competitiveness, we engage in an active research and development program to develop new
products and enhance existing products. As a result of these efforts, we anticipate releasing various new or enhanced products
over the next several years. Our research and development expenses were approximately $6.5 million, $7.6 million, and
$8.5 million for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

        As of December 31, 2013, we had a total of 142 employees working in the R&D department, including 12 with Ph.D.
degrees. We continue to recruit talented engineers to further enhance our research and development capabilities. We have
research and development departments in our facilities in Texas, China and Taiwan. Our research and development teams
collaborate on joint projects, and by co-locating with our manufacturing operations enable us to achieve an efﬁcient cost structure
and improve our time to market.

        A key factor in our research and development success is our highly collaborative process for new product development.
Particularly in our equipment and module businesses, we often collaborate very closely with our customers from a very early
stage in product development. By purposefully fostering this close collaboration, we believe that we can more rapidly develop
leading solutions meeting the needs of our customers.

Manufacturing and Operations

        We have three manufacturing sites: Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. Our research and development
functions are partnered with our manufacturing locations. In our U.S. facility, we manufacture laser chips (utilizing our MBE
process), sub-assemblies and components. The sub-assemblies are used in the manufacture of components by our other
manufacturing facilities or sold to third parties as modules. We manufacture our laser chips only within our U.S. facility, where
our laser design team is located. In our Taiwan location, we manufacture optical components, such as our butterﬂy lasers, which
incorporate laser chips, sub-assemblies and components manufactured within our U.S. facility. In addition, in our Taiwan
location, we manufacture transceivers for the FTTH, internet data center and other markets. In our China facility we take
advantage of lower labor costs and manufacture certain more labor intensive components and optical equipment systems, such as
CATV transmitters (at the headend) and CATV outdoor equipment (at the node). Each facility conducts testing on the
components, modules or subsystems it manufactures and each facility is certiﬁed to ISO 9001:2000.

        Our products are sold to our customers worldwide and also supply our internal component needs for the transceivers and
equipment we manufacture. With a vertically integrated manufacturing process, we produce many of our own laser chips and
other parts required to manufacture our optical components. Through this model, we are able to reduce development time and
product costs as well as enhance quality control. We incorporate our own components into our transceivers, subsystems and
equipment products wherever possible. In instances where

83

Table of Contents

we do not produce components ourselves, we source them from external suppliers and regularly evaluate these relationships in an
attempt to reduce risk and lower cost.

        We depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in our products. We regularly
review our vendor relationships in an attempt to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on one or two
vendors for critical components or raw materials. While maintaining inventories that we believe are sufﬁcient to meet our near-
term needs, we strive not to carry signiﬁcant inventories of raw materials. Accordingly, we maintain ongoing communications
with our vendors in order to help prevent any interruptions in supply, and have implemented a supply-chain management
program to maintain quality and lower purchase prices through standardized purchasing efﬁciencies and design requirements. To
date, we generally have been able to obtain sufﬁcient quantities of quality supplies in a timely manner.

Customers

        Our customers are primarily CATV and telecommunications equipment manufacturers, internet service providers and
internet data center operators. We generally employ a direct sales model in North America and in the rest of the world we use
both direct and indirect sales channels. In 2011, 2012, and 2013 we obtained 84.3%, 85.4% and 88.4% of our revenue,
respectively, through our direct sales efforts and the remainder of our revenue through our indirect sales channels. Our sales
channel partners provide logistical services and day-to-day customer support. Where we sell through an indirect sales channel,
we work with the end customer to establish technological speciﬁcations for our products. Our equipment customers typically
offer our equipment under their brand-name and our equipment is often customized with unique design or performance criteria by
each of these customers. We also from time to time offer design or manufacturing services to customers to assist them in more
effectively using our products and realizing time-to-market advantages.

        In 2013, our products were used by the three largest CATV OEMs, consisting of Cisco Systems, Inc., Arris Group Inc.
(which acquired the Motorola Home Business in 2013) and Aurora Networks (a subsidiary of Pace plc (which acquired the
Harmonic optical business in 2013) and was subsequently itself acquired by Pace plc). The two customers that contributed most
to our revenue in the FTTH market in 2013 were Genexis B.V. and a leading internet service provider. In 2013, our key
customers in the internet data center market included Amazon and Microsoft. In 2013, revenue from the CATV market, data
center market, FTTH market and other markets provided 60.4%, 24.7% and 5.6%, and 9.3% of our revenue, respectively,
compared to 78.6%, 8.3%, 5.8% and 7.3%, respectively in 2012.

        We support our sales efforts by attendance at industry trade shows, technical conferences, advertising in various trade
journals and magazines and other promotional efforts. These efforts are aimed at attracting new customers and enhancing our
existing customer relationships.

Backlog

        We generally make sales pursuant to short-term purchase orders without deposits and subject to rescheduling, revision or
cancellation on short notice. We accordingly believe that purchase orders are not an accurate indicator of our future sales and any
backlog of purchase orders is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue.

84

Table of Contents

Competition

        The optical networking market is intensely competitive. Because of the broad nature of our product offerings, we do not
believe that we face a single major competitor across all of our markets. We do, however, experience intense competition in each
product area from a number of manufacturers and we anticipate that competition will increase. Our major competitors in one or
more of our markets include Avago, Inc., EMCORE Corporation, Finisar Corporation, JDS Uniphase Corporation, Mitsubishi,
NeoPhotonics Corporation, Oclaro, Inc. and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.

        Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have signiﬁcantly greater ﬁnancial, marketing and other resources. In
addition, several of our competitors have large market capitalizations or cash reserves and are much better positioned to acquire
other companies to gain new technologies or products that may displace our products. Network equipment providers, who are our
customers, and network service providers, who are supplied by our customers, may decide to manufacture the optical subsystems
incorporated into their network systems in-house. We also encounter potential customers that, because of existing relationships,
are committed to the products offered by these competitors.

        We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

use of internally manufactured components; 

product breadth and functionality; 

timing and pace of new product development; 

breadth of customer base; 

technological expertise; 

reliability of products; 

product pricing; and 

manufacturing efﬁciency.

        We believe that we compete favorably with respect to the above factors based on our MBE processes, our vertically
integrated model, the performance and reliability of our product offerings and the compelling value we offer to our customers.

Employees

        As of December 31, 2013, we employed 1,146 full-time employees, of which 26 held Ph.D. degrees in a science or
engineering ﬁeld. Of our employees, 229 are located in the U.S., 644 are in China, and 273 are in Taiwan. None of our employees
are represented by any collective bargaining agreement, but certain employees of our China subsidiary are members of a trade
union. We have never suffered any work stoppage and believe that we have satisfactory relations with our employees.

The property is subject to a mortgage in favor of East West Bank, securing our short-term debt obligations. 

Our China subsidiary acquired the land use rights to the real property on which our new facility is located from the Chinese government. The
land use rights expire on October 7, 2054. Our China subsidiary owns the facility located on the property. 

Leases covering four ﬂoors expire on March 31, 2015.

        In 2013, we expanded the amount of square footage utilized by our Taiwan facility, adding a fourth ﬂoor to our then existing
lease space. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our needs in 2014, and that we will be able to obtain
additional commercial space as needed. To meet planned growth in 2015, we plan in late 2014 to investigate expansion of our
laser fabrication facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, and expansion of our transceiver manufacturing facilities in Taipei, Taiwan.

Environmental Matters

        Our research and development and manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of federal, state, local
and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges of pollutants to air and
water, the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, employee health and safety, and the hazardous material
content in our products. Our environmental management systems in our facilities in Ningbo and Taipei are both certiﬁed to meet
the requirements of ISO14001:2004. However, there can be no assurance that violations of applicable laws at any of our facilities
will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. We use, store and dispose of
hazardous materials in our manufacturing operations and hazardous materials are present in our products. We incur costs to
comply with environmental, health and safety requirements, and any failure to comply, or the identiﬁcation of contamination for
which we are found liable, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, monetary ﬁnes, or civil or criminal
penalties, and subject us to property damage and personal injury claims, and result in the suspension of production, alteration of
our manufacturing processes, redesign of our products, or curtailment of sales and adverse publicity. Liability under
environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. For example, pursuant to
environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act, or CERCLA, we may be liable for the full amount of any remediation-related costs at properties we currently own
or formerly owned,

86

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table of Contents

such as our currently owned Sugar Land, Texas facility, or at properties at which we operated, as well as at properties we will
own or operate in the future, and properties to which we have sent hazardous substances, whether or not we caused the
contamination.

        We expect that our operations and products will be affected by new environmental requirements on an ongoing basis.
Environmental, health and safety requirements have become more stringent over time, and changes to existing requirements
could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, or cause us to incur
other signiﬁcant expenses or to modify our manufacturing processes or the hazardous material content of our products.
Identiﬁcation of presently unidentiﬁed environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by a governmental authority,
enactment of more stringent legal requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to adverse publicity, restrict our
operations, affect the design or marketability of our products or otherwise cause us to incur material environmental costs.

        We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming
requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. Some jurisdictions in which our products are sold have
enacted requirements regarding the hazardous material content of certain products. For example, member states of the European
Union and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have placed restrictions on the use of lead, among other
chemicals, in electronic products, which affect the composition and packaging of our products. The passage of such requirements
in additional jurisdictions, or the tightening of standards or elimination of certain exemptions in jurisdictions where our products
are already subject to such requirements, could cause us to incur signiﬁcant expenditures to make our products compliant with
new requirements, or could limit the markets into which we may sell our products. Other governmental regulations may require
us to reengineer our products to use components that are more environmentally compatible, resulting in additional costs to us.

Export Regulations

        The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of
most commercial items that are so called dual-use goods that may have both commercial and military applications. A limited
number of our products are exported by license under the Export Control Classiﬁcation Number, or ECCN, of 5A991. Export
Control Classiﬁcation requirements are dependent upon an item's technical characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the
end-user, and other activities of the end-user. Should the ECCN change, then the export of our products to certain countries
would be restricted. However, we currently do not export our products to any countries on the restricted list, and therefore a
change in the ECCN would not materially impact our business.

Legal Proceedings

        We anticipate that we will from time to time be subject to various claims and legal actions during the ordinary course of our
business. We are not aware of any material claims or legal actions to which we, our properties or our ofﬁcers or directors are
subject.

        The board of directors believes that Mr. C. Lin is qualiﬁed to serve as a director based on his business and ﬁnancial
management and leadership experience and his years of service on our board.

        Our executive ofﬁcers are elected by, and serve at the discretion of, our board of directors. There are no family relationships
among any of our directors or executive ofﬁcers.

Board Composition

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation provides that the number of authorized directors is determined from
time to time by resolution of the board of directors and any vacancies in our board of directors and newly created directorships
may be ﬁlled only by our board of directors. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors
will be distributed among the three classes, so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the total number
of directors. Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation further provides for the removal of a director only for cause
and by the afﬁrmative vote of the holders of 662/3% or more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of our directors. We
currently have seven directors.

        Our board of directors is divided into three classes with members of each class of directors serving for staggered three-year
terms as follows:

•

•

•

Class I directors, Alan Moore and Che-Wei Lin, whose initial terms will expire at the annual meetings held in
2014; 

Class II directors, William H. Yeh and Alex Ignatiev, whose initial terms will expire at the annual meetings held in
2015; and 

Class III directors, Chih-Hsiang (Thompson) Lin, Richard B. Black and Min-Chu (Mike) Chen, whose initial
terms will expire at the annual meetings held in 2016.

        Our classiﬁed board could have the effect of making it more difﬁcult for a third party to acquire us. We have determined that
each of William H. Yeh, Richard B. Black, Alex Ignatiev, Alan Moore, Min-Chu (Mike) Chen and Che-Wei Lin qualify as
independent directors under the NASDAQ rules and SEC rules and regulations.

Director Compensation

        From January 2013 until April 2013, non-employee directors were eligible to receive $1,500 for each board meeting
attended in person, and a $300 meeting fee for each board or committee

meeting attended by telephone. In April 2013, our board of directors approved increasing the meeting fee for each board meeting
attended by telephone to $750 for meetings lasting two hours or less, and $1,500 for meetings lasting longer than two hours. In
April 2013, our board of directors also approved providing our non-employee directors with a $12,000 annual retainer fee. Non-
employee directors that serve as the Chairman of our board of directors, chairman of our audit committee, chairman of our
compensation committee and chairman of our nominating and corporate governance committee are entitled to receive an
additional $5,000, $5,000, $3,000 and $2,000 annual retainer fee, respectively. If a committee meeting occurred at the same site
as a scheduled board meeting, no additional compensation was paid. Employee directors did not receive any compensation other
than their employee compensation for their service as directors. Directors were reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
the course of their service on the board of directors or its committees.

        In April 2013, our board of directors approved providing non-employee directors with a number of restricted stock units
under our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan equal to $55,000 divided by the then-current share price of our common stock. All
restricted stock units granted to directors vest in equal monthly amounts over the ﬁrst twelve months following the date of grant,
subject to early termination in accordance with their terms.

        The table below sets forth, for each person who served as a non-employee director during 2013, information regarding
compensation for service on our board of directors during 2013.

Board Committees

        Our board of directors directs the management of our business and affairs, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its
business through meetings of the board of directors. Our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a
compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Our board of directors may establish other
committees to facilitate the management of our business.

Audit Committee

        Our audit committee currently consists of Richard B. Black, Alan Moore and Alex Ignatiev. Our board of directors has
determined that Messrs. Black, Moore and Ignatiev each satisfy the independence and ﬁnancial literacy requirements under the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ. Mr. Black serves as the chairman of this committee, and our board of
directors has determined that he qualiﬁes as an "audit committee ﬁnancial expert" as that term is deﬁned in the rules and
regulations established by the SEC and has the requisite ﬁnancial sophistication as deﬁned under the applicable NASDAQ rules.
The functions of this committee include, but are not limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

meeting with our management periodically to consider the adequacy of our internal controls and the objectivity of
our ﬁnancial reporting; 

meeting with our independent auditors and with internal ﬁnancial personnel regarding these matters; 

appointing, compensating, retaining and overseeing the work of our independent auditors; 

pre-approving audit and non-audit services of our independent auditors;

management, including any signiﬁcant adjustments, management judgments and estimates, new accounting

internal accounting controls or auditing matters, as well as for the conﬁdential, anonymous submission by our
employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters; 

reviewing the independence and quality control procedures of the independent auditor and the experience and
qualiﬁcations of the independent auditor's senior personnel that are providing us audit services; 

reviewing all related-party transactions for approval; and

changes to our board of directors.

94

Table of Contents

        Both our independent auditors and internal ﬁnancial personnel regularly meet privately with our audit committee and have
unrestricted access to this committee.

Compensation Committee

        Our compensation committee currently consists of William H. Yeh, Richard B. Black and Min-Chu (Mike) Chen, each of
whom is not an employee and is otherwise "independent" as that term is deﬁned in the current applicable NASDAQ rules.
Mr. Yeh serves as the chairman of this committee. Pursuant to its charter, our compensation committee has responsibility for
overseeing our compensation policies and programs, including developing compensation policies and providing oversight in the
implementation of all applicable policies and beneﬁt plans. Speciﬁcally, the compensation committee recommends the
compensation payable to our non-employee directors, evaluates and sets compensation for the Chairman of our board of directors
and our executive ofﬁcers and monitors all general compensation programs. In accordance with its charter, the compensation
committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

reviewing and approving all compensation for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, including incentive-based and equity-
based compensation; 

reviewing and approving annual performance objectives and goals relevant to compensation for the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer and evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer;

provisions including the same, applicable to executive ofﬁcers; 

periodically reviewing and advising our board of directors concerning both regional and industry-wide
compensation practices and trends in order to assess the adequacy and competitiveness of our compensation
programs for executive ofﬁcers relative to comparable companies in our industry; 

reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of the compensation committee charter and recommending any changes
to our board of directors on an annual basis; and 

reviewing and evaluating the compensation committee's own performance periodically.

        The compensation committee may delegate its authority to a subcommittee to make grants of stock, stock options and other
equity securities to executive ofﬁcers and other employees, provided that these grants are made within established guidelines. In
addition, the compensation committee may obtain advice or assistance from compensation consultants, legal counsel or other
advisors to perform its duties, provided that the compensation committee shall periodically assess the independence of any such
compensation consultant as required by NASDAQ rules and applicable law.

oversees and advises the board of directors with respect to corporate governance matters, assists the board of directors in
identifying and recommending qualiﬁed candidates for nomination to the board of directors, makes recommendations to the
board of directors with respect to assignments to committees of the board of directors and oversees the evaluation of the board of

considering director candidates submitted by stockholders and determining the procedure to be followed by
stockholders in submitting such recommendations; 

recommending board of directors committee structure and responsibilities to be included in the charter of each
committee of the board of directors to be submitted to full board of directors for consideration;

committees as the nominating and corporate governance committee deems appropriate;

board of directors for any adjustments.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation Decisions

        None of our executive ofﬁcers serves as a member of our compensation committee or as a member of the board of directors
or any other committee serving an equivalent function of any other entity that has one or more of its executive ofﬁcers serving as
a member of our board of directors or compensation committee.

Code of Business Conduct

        Our board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct. The code of business conduct applies to all of our
employees, ofﬁcers and directors. The full text of our code of business conduct is posted on our website at www.ao-inc.com
under the Investor Relations section. We intend to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our code of business
conduct, or waivers of such provisions, at the same location on our website identiﬁed above and also in public ﬁlings.

Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs

        We do not believe that our compensation programs create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
our company. We believe that the combination of different types of compensation as well as the overall amount of compensation,
together with our internal controls and oversight by the board of directors, mitigates potential risks.

Tax and Accounting Considerations

        Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1,000,000
paid to their Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and certain other executive ofﬁcers unless certain performance and other requirements are
met. As one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the compensation committee also considers the
anticipated tax treatment to our company and to the executive ofﬁcers of various payments and beneﬁts, including the effect of
Section 162(m). The compensation committee retains discretion, however, to implement executive compensation programs that
may not be deductible under Section 162(m) if the compensation committee believes the programs are nevertheless appropriate to
help achieve our primary objective of ensuring that compensation paid to our executive ofﬁcers is reasonable, performance-based
and consistent with the goals of our company and its stockholders. We do not believe that Code Section 162(m) will limit our tax
deductions for our last completed ﬁscal year.

Agreements with Executive Ofﬁcers

        Change of Control or Separation of Service Agreements with Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Other Executive Ofﬁcers

        Each of Mr. Lin, Mr. Murry and Mr. J. Yeh has an agreement regarding change of control or separation of service with our
company, which provides that, if our board of directors terminates his employment for any reason other than Cause or if he
resigns for Good Reason before the occurrence of a Change in Control, as deﬁned below, he will be entitled to receive (i) a
payment equal to one year's base salary plus $15,000, (which may be used for beneﬁt continuation under COBRA or for any
other purpose), (ii) a payment equal to his target bonus and (iii) in the case of Mr. Murry, a lump sum equal to Mr. Murry's four
most recent commission payments. The severance beneﬁts that may arise as a result of a termination prior to a Change in Control
will be paid periodically in installments over the 12 months following his separation from service, subject to certain limitations
including his execution of a release agreement. The release agreement would include a reasonable agreement to cooperate for a
period of six months following the employment termination date and a mutual non-disparagement clause. In consideration of
these beneﬁts, he has agreed to be subject to a non-compete provision for a period of 12 months following his separation from
service and would agree to maintain the conﬁdentiality of company information. Mr. Dunn's and Mr. Chang's employment
agreement do not provide for the above beneﬁts.

        Each employment agreement generally deﬁnes "Cause" as, following written notice to the executive and the executive's
failure to cure such occurrence(s): (i) conviction or plea of nolo contendre to any felony offense or to a crime of moral turpitude;
(ii) commission of willful misconduct or violation of law in connection with the performance of his duties, including
(a) misappropriation of funds or property, (b) attempting to secure personally any proﬁt in connection with any transaction
entered into on behalf of our company, or (c) making any material misrepresentation to our board of directors, our company or its
afﬁliates; (iii) material violation or failure to comply with our company policy; (iv) material breach of the employment
agreement; or (v) the willful and continued failure or neglect to substantially perform his duties with our company. "Good
Reason" is deﬁned to include: (i) the executive's assignment to duties inconsistent with his position or title; (ii) reduction in his
base compensation, except as part of an overall cost reduction program that affects all senior executives and does not
disproportionately affect the executive; (iii) any purported termination of the executive by our company other than for disability
or Cause or a voluntary resignation initiated by the executive, except for a voluntary termination for Good Reason; (iv) failure of
any successor entity to our company to expressly assume the employment agreement; and (v) material breach by our company of
the agreement.

        Each of Mr. Lin, Mr. Murry, Mr. J. Yeh, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Chang have provisions in their employment agreements that
provide if, within one year after a Change in Control or within six months prior to a Change in Control, the executive's
employment is terminated by the executive for Good Reason or by our company other than for Cause, the executive will instead
be entitled

101

Table of Contents

to receive severance beneﬁts consisting of: (i) a lump sum payment equal to one year's base salary plus $10,000 ($15,000 for
Mr. Dunn and Mr. Chang) which may be used for beneﬁt continuation under COBRA or for any other purpose; (ii) a lump sum
payment equal to his target bonus; and (iii) accelerated vesting of the executive's stock options, with all vested options becoming
exercisable for an extended period following termination of employment. The severance beneﬁts that may arise as a result of
termination within one year following a Change in Control will be paid on the later of the 60th day after the effective date of the
executive's separation from service or six months and one day after executive's separation from service if the executive is, at the
time of termination, a "speciﬁed employee" as deﬁned under Section 409A of the Code. Additionally, Mr. Lin's employment
agreement provides him with a tax gross-up payment to make him whole for any excise taxes that he would owe resulting from
the application of the 20% excise tax provisions under Section 280G of the Code, that apply when certain "parachute payments"
are paid to Mr. Lin as the result of a Change in Control. None of the other employment agreements with our executive ofﬁcers
provide them with any right to a tax gross-up.

        A "Change in Control" is deemed to occur if: (i) individuals who constitute the board of directors of our company on the
date of the employment agreement (Incumbent Directors) cease to constitute at least a majority of our board of directors;
provided, that any individual whose election or nomination for election by the stockholders was approved by a majority of the
then Incumbent Directors shall be considered an Incumbent Director, with certain exceptions; or (ii) the stockholders of our
company approve (1) any merger, consolidation or recapitalization of our company or any sale of substantially all of its assets
where (a) the stockholders of our company prior to the transaction do not, immediately thereafter, own at least 51% of both the
equity and voting power of the surviving entity or (b) the Incumbent Directors at the time of the approval of the transaction
would not immediately thereafter constitute a majority of the board of directors of the surviving entity, or (2) any plan of
liquidation or dissolution of our company.

Equity Compensation Plans

2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan

        Our board of directors and stockholders adopted and approved our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or the 2013 Plan,
effective as of September 26, 2013. The following is a brief summary of the material terms of our 2013 Plan.

Purpose

        The purpose of our 2013 Plan is to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants by providing them with additional
incentives, and to promote the success of our company's business.

Administration

        Our board of directors or one or more committees appointed by our board of directors administers the 2013 Plan. For this
purpose our board of directors has delegated general administrative authority for the 2013 Plan to the compensation committee. A
committee may delegate some or all of its authority with respect to the 2013 Plan to another committee of directors and may
delegate certain limited award grant authority to one or more ofﬁcers of our company. (The appropriate acting body, be it our
board of directors, a committee within its delegated authority, or an ofﬁcer within his or her delegated authority, is referred to in
this summary as the "Administrator.") The Administrator determines the number of shares that are

102

Table of Contents

subject to awards and the terms and conditions of such awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award.
Along with other authority granted to the Administrator under the 2013 Plan, the Administrator may (i) determine fair market
value, (ii) select recipients of awards, (iii) determine the number of shares subject to awards, (iv) approve form award
agreements, (v) determine the terms and conditions of awards, (vi) reduce the exercise price of outstanding awards without
participant consent, (vii) amend outstanding awards, and (viii) allow participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations through a
reduction of shares.

Eligibility

        Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2013 Plan include our ofﬁcers, employees, consultants and members of our
board of directors. The Administrator determines from time to time the participants to whom awards will be granted.

Authorized shares; limits on awards

        The maximum number of common shares that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2013 Plan equals
800,000, which number includes shares remaining available under our prior plans as described below and shares subject to
outstanding awards forfeited back to our prior plans, all of which may be subject to incentive stock option treatment. The
maximum aggregate number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to all awards under the 2013 Plan shall increase
annually on the ﬁrst day of each ﬁscal year following the adoption of the 2013 Plan by the number of common shares equal to the
lesser of (i) 333,333 shares, (ii) 2% of the total issued and outstanding common shares on the ﬁrst day of such ﬁscal year, or
(iii) such lesser amount determined by our board of directors. Additionally, the maximum number of shares subject to those
options and stock appreciation rights that are granted during any calendar year to any individual under the 2013 Plan is 600,000
shares.

        To the extent that an award is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there
been no such cash or other settlement will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. To the
extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option, or to satisfy the tax
withholding obligations under an award, then only the shares actually issued shall be counted against the applicable share limits.
Shares that are subject to or underlie awards that expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or
for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2013 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2013
Plan. Additionally, shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by our company as full or partial payment in
connection with any award under the 2013 Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by our company to
satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award under the 2013 Plan, will be available for subsequent awards under
the 2013 Plan and are not counted against the applicable share limits.

        As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, the number and kind of shares available under the 2013 Plan and the then
outstanding share-based awards, as well as exercise or purchase prices, performance targets under certain performance-based
awards and share limits, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, consolidations,
recapitalizations, dividends, stock splits, a split-up or a spin-off, repurchases or exchange, or other similar events, or
extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.

103

Table of Contents

Incentive awards

        The 2013 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, or SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance shares and performance units, as well as other awards (described in the 2013 Plan) that are responsive to changing
developments in management compensation. The 2013 Plan retains the ﬂexibility to offer competitive incentives and to tailor
beneﬁts to speciﬁc needs and circumstances. Any award may be paid or settled in cash. An option or SAR will expire, or other
award will vest in accordance with the schedule set forth in the applicable award agreement.

Stock option.  A stock option is the right to purchase common shares at a future date at a speciﬁed price per share
generally equal to, but no less than, the fair market value of a share on the date of grant. An option may either be
an Incentive Stock Option, or ISO, or a nonstatutory stock option, or NSO. ISO beneﬁts are taxed differently from
NSOs, as described under "Federal Income Tax Treatment of Awards under the 2013 Plan," below. ISOs also are
subject to more restrictive terms and are limited in amount by the Code and the 2013 Plan. Full payment for
shares purchased on the exercise of any option must be made at the time of such exercise in a manner approved by
the Administrator. 

SAR.  A SAR is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a
common share on the date of exercise of the SAR over the base price of the SAR. The base price will be
established by the Administrator at the time of grant of the SAR but will not be less than the fair market value of a
share on the date of grant. SARs may be granted in connection with other awards or independently. 

Restricted stock award.  A restricted stock award is typically for a ﬁxed number of common shares subject to
restrictions. The Administrator speciﬁes the price, if any, the participant must pay for such shares and the
restrictions (which may include, for example, continued service and/or performance standards) imposed on such
shares. A stock bonus may be granted by the Administrator to any eligible person to reward exceptional or special
services, contributions or achievements in the manner and on such terms and conditions (including any
restrictions on such shares) as determined from time to time by the Administrator. The number of shares so
awarded shall be determined by the Administrator and may be granted independently or in lieu of a cash bonus. 

Restricted stock unit.  A restricted stock unit is similar to a SAR except that it entitles the recipient to receive an
amount equal to the fair market value of a common share. 

Performance-based award.  A performance-based award is designed to satisfy the requirements for deductibility
under Section 162(m) of the Code (in addition to other awards expressly authorized under the 2013 Plan which
may also qualify as performance-based) and may be based on the performance of our company and/or one or
more of our subsidiaries, divisions, segments, or units. The business criteria from which performance goals will
be established are listed in the 2013 Plan under the term "Performance Goals." Performance goals may be
adjusted to reﬂect certain changes, including reorganizations, liquidations and capitalization and accounting
changes, to the extent permitted by Section 162(m). Performance-based awards may be share-based (payable in
stock only or in cash or stock) or may be cash-only awards (in either case, subject to the limits described under the
heading "Authorized Shares; Limits on Awards" above). Before any performance-based award is paid, the
Administrator must certify that the performance goals have been satisﬁed. The Administrator has discretion to
determine

104

Table of Contents

the performance goals and restrictions or other limitations of the individual awards and reserves discretion to
reduce payments below maximum award limits.

        The Administrator may grant stock unit awards and permit deferred payment of awards, and may determine the form and
timing of payment, vesting and other terms applicable to stock units or deferrals.

Acceleration of awards; possible early termination of awards

        Upon a change in control of our company, outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan will be assumed or substituted on the
same terms. However, if the successor corporation does not assume or substitute the outstanding awards, then vesting of these
awards will fully accelerate, and in the case of options or stock appreciation rights, will become immediately exercisable. For this
purpose a change in control is deﬁned to include certain changes in the majority of our board of directors, the sale of all or
substantially all of our company's assets and the consummation of certain mergers or consolidations.

Transfer restrictions

        Subject to certain exceptions, awards under the 2013 Plan are not transferable by the recipient other than by will or the laws
of descent and distribution and are generally exercisable, during the recipient's lifetime, only by him or her.

Termination of or changes to the 2013 Plan

        Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2013 Plan at any time and in any manner. Unless required by applicable
law or listing agency rule, stockholder approval for any amendment will not be required. Unless previously terminated by our
board of directors, the 2013 Plan will terminate in September 2023 upon the tenth anniversary of the completion of our initial
public offering. Generally speaking, outstanding awards may be amended, subject, however, to the consent of the holder if the
amendment materially and adversely affects the holder.

Federal income tax treatment of awards under the 2013 Plan

        Federal income tax consequences (subject to change) relating to awards under the 2013 Plan are summarized in the
following discussion. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other considerations, does not describe the
deferred compensation provisions of Section 409A of the Code to the extent an award is subject to and does not satisfy those
rules, nor does it describe state, local, or international tax consequences.

        For "NSOs," our company is generally entitled to deduct (and the optionee recognizes taxable income in) an amount equal to
the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. For ISOs, our
company is generally not entitled to a deduction nor does the participant recognize income at the time of exercise. The current
federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the 2013 Plan generally follow certain basic patterns: SARs
are taxed and deductible in substantially the same manner as NSOs; nontransferable restricted stock subject to a substantial risk
of forfeiture results in income recognition equal to the excess of the fair market value over the price paid (if any) only at the time
the restrictions lapse (unless the recipient elects to accelerate recognition as of the date of grant); bonuses and performance share
awards are generally subject to tax at the time of payment; cash-based awards are generally subject to tax at the time of payment;
and

105

Table of Contents

compensation otherwise effectively deferred is taxed when paid. Our company will generally have a corresponding deduction at
the time the participant recognizes income. However, as for those awards subject to ISO treatment, our company would generally
have no corresponding compensation deduction.

        If an award is accelerated under the 2013 Plan in connection with a change in control (as this term is used under the Code),
our company may not be permitted to deduct the portion of the compensation attributable to the acceleration ("parachute
payments") if it exceeds certain threshold limits under the Code (and certain related excise taxes may be triggered). Furthermore,
the aggregate compensation in excess of $1,000,000 attributable to awards which are not "performance-based" within the
meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, or do not fall within any other applicable exception, may not be permitted to be deducted
by our company in certain circumstances.

Various Incentive Share Plans

        Our board of directors previously adopted, and our stockholders previously approved, the 1998 Share Incentive Plan, the
2000 Share Incentive Plan, the 2004 Share Incentive Plan and the 2006 Share Incentive Plan, which are referred to collectively as
our Prior Plans. As of January 31, 2014, we had 1,562,437 shares of common stock subject to outstanding stock options under
our Prior Plans with a weighted average exercise price of $8.7743 per share. In connection with the effectiveness of our 2013
Plan, no further awards may be granted under the Prior Plans. However, all outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will
continue to exist and will continue to be governed by their existing terms. Upon a change in control of our company, as described
in each of the Prior Plans, the vesting of stock options and other outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will be accelerated and
all unexercised awards will terminate upon the change in control to the extent the acquirer does not assume the outstanding stock
options.

Section 401(k) Plan

        We maintain a tax-qualiﬁed retirement plan that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a
tax-advantaged basis. All participants' interests in their contributions are 100% vested when contributed. Historically, we have
not made any matching contributions to the Section 401(k) plan. Pre-tax contributions are allocated to each participant's
individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants' directions. The
retirement plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code.

Indemniﬁcation of Directors and Ofﬁcers and Limitation of Liability

        As permitted by Delaware General Corporation Law, provisions in our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws limit or eliminate the personal liability of our directors. Consequently, a director will not be
personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of ﬁduciary duty as a director, except for liability for:

•

•

any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; 

any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

106

Table of Contents

•

•

any unlawful payments related to dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other distributions; or 

any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal beneﬁt.

        These limitations of liability do not alter director liability under the federal securities laws and do not affect the availability
of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that:

•

•

•

we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our directors or
ofﬁcers or is or was serving at our request as a director or ofﬁcer of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, or other enterprise; 

we may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our employees
or agents or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, or other enterprise; and 

we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a director or ofﬁcer in advance of the ﬁnal disposition of
any action or proceeding, subject to very limited exceptions.

Indemniﬁcation Agreements

        We have entered into agreements that indemnify each of our directors and certain of our executive ofﬁcers, in addition to the
indemniﬁcation provided for in our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. These
agreements, among other things, provide for indemniﬁcation for judgments, ﬁnes, settlement amounts and expenses, including
attorneys' fees incurred by the director or executive ofﬁcer in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in our right,
arising out of the person's services as a director or executive ofﬁcer, or any other company or enterprise to which the person
provides services at our request. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualiﬁed
persons as directors and executive ofﬁcers.

        The limitations on liability and indemniﬁcation provisions in our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their
ﬁduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and ofﬁcers, even though a derivative
action, if successful, might otherwise beneﬁt us and our stockholders. A stockholder's investment in us may be adversely affected
to the extent we pay the costs of settlement or damage awards against our directors and ofﬁcers under these indemniﬁcation
provisions.

        At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or ofﬁcers in which indemniﬁcation is
sought, nor are we aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemniﬁcation.

compensation for each month of such services that Mr. Yeh rendered to us. As a result, we granted Mr. Yeh 2,133 shares of
common stock on August 1, 2010 for 16 months of services rendered and 1,333 shares of common stock on June 1, 2011 for

PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS 

        The following table sets forth the beneﬁcial ownership information of our common stock as of January 31, 2014, and as
adjusted to reﬂect the sale of the shares of common stock in this offering, for:

•

•

•

•

•

each person known to us to be the beneﬁcial owner of more than 5% of our common stock outstanding; 

each named executive ofﬁcer; 

each of our directors; 

all of our executive ofﬁcers and directors as a group; and 

each selling stockholder.

        We have determined beneﬁcial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneﬁcial
ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities
and include stock options and warrants that are immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. Except as indicated by the
footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have
sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneﬁcially owned by them, subject to applicable
community property laws. This information is not necessarily indicative of beneﬁcial ownership for any other purpose.

        In computing the number of shares of common stock beneﬁcially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that
person, we deemed to be outstanding shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person that are currently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of January 31, 2014. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the
purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneﬁcial ownership representing less than 1.0% is denoted
with an asterisk (*).

        Percentage ownership calculations for beneﬁcial ownership before this offering are based on 12,660,885 shares of common
stock outstanding as of January 31, 2014. Percentage ownership

General

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following description of our capital stock is intended as a summary only and is qualiﬁed in its entirety by reference to
our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which have been ﬁled with the SEC as

Common Stock

        As of December 31, 2013, there were 12,643,954 shares of our common stock outstanding and held of record by 358
stockholders. The actual number of holders of our common stock is greater than the number of record holders and includes
stockholders who are beneﬁcial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and nominees. The number of
holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities. Holders of our common
stock are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held of record for the election of directors and on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of our common stock are also entitled to receive dividends ratably, if any, as may be
declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds, subject to any preferential dividend rights of any preferred stock
then outstanding. Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in
our net assets legally available after the payment of all our debts and other liabilities, subject to the preferential rights of any
preferred stock then outstanding. Holders of our common stock have no subscription, preemptive, redemption or conversion
rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the
rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future. Except with respect
to the election of directors (which is determined by our stockholders by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to
vote on the election) and as described below in "Provisions of our Certiﬁcate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware Anti-
Takeover Law," a majority vote of common stockholders is generally required to take action under our amended and restated
certiﬁcate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.

Preferred Stock

        Our board of directors is authorized, without action by the stockholders, to designate and issue up to an aggregate of
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can ﬁx the rights, preferences and privileges of
the shares of each series and any of its qualiﬁcations, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance
of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of
common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing ﬂexibility in connection with possible future ﬁnancings and
acquisitions and other corporate purposes could, under certain circumstances, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
a change in control of our company and might harm the market price of our common stock.

        Our board of directors will make any determination to issue such shares based on its judgment as to our company's best
interests and the best interests of our stockholders. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Warrants

        As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding warrants to purchase:

•

•

•

15,999 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.25 per share. 

9,999 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share. 

6,667 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $10.50 per share.

Registration Rights

        There are approximately 1.45 million shares of our common stock entitled to registration rights, excluding the shares
issuable upon the exercise of warrants for our common stock and assuming that the underwriters' overallotment option is not
exercised. The registration rights granted under these registration rights agreements are subject to conditions and limitations,
including our right to limit the number of shares included in such a registration upon advisement of the managing underwriter and
our right not to effect a requested registration if the aggregate price to the public is less than $2,000,000.

Demand registration rights

        At any time more than 180 days after our initial public offering on September 26, 2013, the holders of a majority of the
shares of registrable common stock, subject to exceptions, are entitled to demand registration of all or any of such shares and
require us to ﬁle a registration statement under the Securities Act at our expense.

S-3 demand registration rights

        The holders of the shares of registrable common stock, subject to exceptions, are entitled to demand registration rights
pursuant to which they may require us to ﬁle, as soon as practicable, one registration statement under the Securities Act on
Form S-3 in any 12-month period with respect to these shares. We have the ability to delay the ﬁling of a registration statement
under speciﬁed conditions, such as if we are in possession of material non-public information that would not be in our best
interests to disclose.

Piggyback registration rights

        If we propose to register any of our securities under the Securities Act for our own account or the account of any other
holder, the holders of the shares of registrable common stock are entitled to notice of such registration and are entitled to include
these shares in the registration, subject to exceptions, including our right to limit the number of shares included in the
registration.

        We will pay all registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other expenses
(including all fees and expenses of the consultants, advisors, attorneys, special experts and other third parties engaged by the
holders of the shares of registrable common stock, and all relevant taxes, including transfer taxes), related to the foregoing
demand, S-3 or piggyback registration rights. The registration rights agreements contain customary cross-indemniﬁcation
provisions, pursuant to which we are obligated to indemnify the selling stockholders in the event of material misstatements or
omissions in the registration

statement attributable to us, and they are obligated to indemnify us for material misstatements or omissions attributable to them.

Provisions of Our Certiﬁcate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware Anti-Takeover Law

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that
may have the effect of encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to
negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. These provisions include the items
described below.

Board composition and ﬁlling vacancies

        In accordance with our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation, our board of directors is divided into three classes
serving staggered three year terms, with one class being elected each year. Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation
also provides that directors may be removed only for cause and then only by the afﬁrmative vote of the holders of 662/3% or
more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Furthermore, any vacancy on our board of directors, however
occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of our board of directors, may only be ﬁlled by the
afﬁrmative vote of a majority of our directors then in ofﬁce even if less than a quorum.

No written consent of stockholders

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation provides that all stockholder actions are required to be taken by a vote
of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting, and that stockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a
meeting.

Meetings of stockholders

        Our amended and restated bylaws provide that only a majority of the members of our board of directors then in ofﬁce, the
Chairman of the board of directors or the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer may call special meetings of stockholders and only those
matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered or acted upon at a special meeting of stockholders. Our
amended and restated bylaws limit the business that may be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders to those matters
properly brought before the meeting.

Advance notice requirements

        Our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the
nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These
procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our corporate secretary before the
meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive ofﬁces not
less than 90 days or more than 120 days before the ﬁrst anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. The notice
must contain certain information speciﬁed in our amended and restated bylaws.

Amendment to bylaws and certiﬁcate of incorporation

        As required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, any amendment of our amended and restated certiﬁcate of
incorporation must ﬁrst be approved by a majority of our board of directors

117

Table of Contents

and, if required by law or our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation, thereafter be approved by a majority of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, and a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote
thereon as a class, except that the amendment of the provisions relating to stockholder action, directors, limitation of liability and
the amendment of our amended and restated bylaws and amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation must be approved by
not less than 662/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, and not less than 662/3% of the outstanding
shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class. Our bylaws may be amended by the afﬁrmative vote of a majority vote of
the directors then in ofﬁce, subject to any limitations set forth in the bylaws; and may also be amended by the afﬁrmative vote of
at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the amendment, or, if the board of directors recommends that the
stockholders approve the amendment, by the afﬁrmative vote of the majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on the
amendment, in each case voting together as a single class.

Blank check preferred stock

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation authorizes 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The existence of
authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable our board of directors to render more difﬁcult or to discourage an
attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise
of its ﬁduciary obligations, our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interests of us or
our stockholders, our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or
more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent
stockholder or stockholder group. In this regard, our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation grants our board of
directors' broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. The issuance
of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of
common stock. The issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of these holders and may
have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us.

Choice of Forum

        Our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of ﬁduciary duty; (c) any action asserting a claim against us
arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation or our amended
or restated bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However,
several lawsuits involving other companies are currently pending challenging the validity of choice of forum provisions in
certiﬁcates of incorporation, and it is possible that a court could rule that such provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.

Anti-takeover effects of the Delaware general corporation law

        We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or Section 203. In general,
Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested
stockholder" for a 3-year period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the business
combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business combination" includes, among

118

Table of Contents

other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a ﬁnancial beneﬁt to the interested stockholder. An
"interested stockholder" is a person who, together with afﬁliates and associates, owns, or did own within the three years before
the determination of interested stockholder status, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock. Under Section 203, a business
combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisﬁes one of the following conditions:

•

•

•

before the stockholder became interested, the board of directors approved either the business combination or the
transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; 

upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the
interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the
transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by
persons who are directors and also ofﬁcers, and employee stock plans, in some instances; or 

at or after the time the stockholder became interested, the business combination was approved by the board of
directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the afﬁrmative
vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

NASDAQ Global Market Listing

        Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol "AAOI."

Transfer Agent and Registrar

        Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acts as the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock. The transfer
agent and registrar's address is 17 Battery Place, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10004.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE 

        Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur,
could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Upon completion of this offering, we will have outstanding an
aggregate of                       shares of common stock, assuming the issuance by us of the 1,300,000 shares of common stock
offered in this offering and no other exercise of outstanding options or warrants. Of these shares, (i) the 4,140,000 shares issued
in our initial public offering and (ii) the 2,700,000 shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further
registration under the Securities Act, except for any shares purchased by our "afﬁliates," as that term is deﬁned in Rule 144(a)
under the Securities Act, whose sales would be subject to certain limitations and restrictions described below.

        The remaining                       shares of common stock held by existing stockholders were issued and sold by us in reliance on
exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Of these shares,

•

•

•

approximately 0.1 million shares are eligible for immediate sale; 

approximately                       million shares will become eligible for sale on March 25, 2014 upon the expiration of
lock-up agreements executed in connection with our initial public offering, subject in some cases to volume and
other restrictions of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements; and 

approximately                       million shares will be eligible for sale upon the expiration of 90-day lock-up
agreements entered into in connection with this offering, subject in some cases to volume and other restrictions of
Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act and various vesting agreements.

        In addition, holders of stock options could exercise such options and sell certain of the shares issued upon exercise. Of
the                       shares of common stock that were subject to stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2013, options to
purchase                       shares were vested as of December 31, 2013.

Lock-Up Agreements

        In connection with our initial public offering, we and all directors and ofﬁcers, as well as holders of substantially all of our
outstanding stock and stock options (including the selling stockholders) agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, without the
prior written consent of Raymond James and Piper Jaffray, as representatives on behalf of the underwriters, we and they would
not, until March 25, 2014, dispose of any shares of our stock or options, warrants or other securities with respect to our stock,
enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of our common stock, or ﬁle or cause to be ﬁled any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the offering of any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for common stock (other than any registration statement on Form S-8). There are no agreements between Raymond
James and Piper Jaffray, as representatives on behalf of the underwriters, our company and any of our securityholders or afﬁliates
releasing them from these lock-up agreements prior to March 25, 2014 except with respect to the shares being sold in this
offering.

120

Table of Contents

        The agreements do not contain any pre-established conditions to the waiver by Raymond James and Piper Jaffray on behalf
of the underwriters of any terms of the lock-up agreements. Any determination to release shares subject to the lock-up
agreements would be based on a number of factors at the time of the determination, including but not necessarily limited to the
market price of the common stock, the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock, general market conditions, the
number of shares proposed to be sold and the timing, purpose and terms of the proposed sale.

        In addition, in connection with this offering, we and all directors and ofﬁcers, and all of the selling stockholders have signed
lock-up agreements under which we and they have agreed not to sell, transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of
our common stock of any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of our common stock without the
prior written consent of Raymond James and Piper Jaffray for a period of 90 days after the date of this prospectus. The
agreements are subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the section of this prospectus entitled "Underwriters."

Rule 144

        In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who is not our afﬁliate and has not been our afﬁliate at any time
during the preceding 90 days and who is not a party to a lock-up agreement as described above will be entitled to sell any shares
of our common stock that such person has beneﬁcially owned for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior
owner other than one of our afﬁliates, without regard to manner of sale, volume limitations or notice provisions of Rule 144.
These sales of our common stock by any such person would be subject to the availability of current public information about us if
the shares to be sold were beneﬁcially owned by such person for less than one year.

        In addition, under Rule 144, a person may sell shares of our common stock acquired from us immediately upon the closing
of this offering, without regard to volume limitations or the availability of public information about us, if:

•

•

the person is not our afﬁliate and has not been our afﬁliate at any time during the preceding 90 days; and 

the person has beneﬁcially owned the shares to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any
prior owner other than one of our afﬁliates.

        Subject to the lock-up agreements described above, our afﬁliates who have beneﬁcially owned shares of our common stock
for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our afﬁliates, will be entitled to sell
within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:

•

•

1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately
                       shares immediately after this offering; and 

the average weekly trading volume in our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market during the four
calendar weeks preceding the date of ﬁling of a Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 with
respect to the sale.

        Sales under Rule 144 by our afﬁliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the
availability of current public information about us.

121

Table of Contents

Rule 701

        Rule 701 of the Securities Act, as in effect on the date of this prospectus, permits resales of shares in reliance upon
Rule 144, but without compliance with certain restrictions of Rule 144. Most of our employees, executive ofﬁcers, directors or
consultants who purchased shares under a written compensatory plan or contract may be entitled to rely on the resale provisions
of Rule 701. Subject to any applicable lock-up agreements, Rule 701 provides that afﬁliates may sell their Rule 701 shares under
Rule 144 without complying with the holding period, public information, volume limitation or notice requirements of Rule 144.

Stock Options

        We ﬁled a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register all shares of common stock subject to
outstanding stock options and common stock issued or issuable under our stock plans.

Registration Rights

        Upon the closing of this offering, the holders of approximately          million shares of our common stock will be eligible to
exercise certain rights with respect to the registration of such shares under the Securities Act, assuming that the underwriters'
overallotment option is not exercised. See "Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights." Upon the effectiveness of a
registration statement covering these shares, such shares would become freely tradable.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS 

        This section summarizes the material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of
our common stock by a non-U.S. holder. For purposes of this summary, a "non-U.S. holder" is any beneﬁcial owner that for U.S.
federal income tax purposes is not a U.S. person. The term "U.S. person" means:

•

•

•

•

an individual citizen or resident of the U.S.; 

a corporation or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under
the laws of the U.S. or any state, including the District of Columbia, or otherwise treated as such for U.S. federal
income tax purposes; 

an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of source; or 

a trust (i) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the U.S. and which has one
or more U.S. persons who have authority to control all substantive decisions of the trust or (ii) which has a valid
election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

        Generally, an individual may be treated as a resident of the U.S. in any calendar year for U.S. federal income tax purposes
by, among other ways, being present in the U.S. for at least 31 days in that calendar year and for an aggregate of at least 183 days
during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year. For purposes of this calculation, such individual would count all of
the days in which the individual was present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately preceding year,
and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year. Residents are taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if they
were citizens of the U.S.

        This summary does not consider the tax consequences for partnerships, entities classiﬁed as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, or persons who hold their interests through a partnership or other entity classiﬁed as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is
a beneﬁcial owner of common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships that are beneﬁcial owners of our common stock, and partners in such
partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the ownership and disposition of our
common stock.

        This summary applies only to non-U.S. holders who acquire our common stock pursuant to this offering and who hold our
common stock as a capital asset (generally property held for investment). This summary generally does not address tax
considerations that may be relevant to particular investors because of their speciﬁc circumstances, or because they are subject to
special rules. Certain former U.S. citizens or long-term residents, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment
companies, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, life insurance companies, tax-exempt
organizations, dealers in securities or currencies, brokers, banks or other ﬁnancial institutions, certain trusts, hybrid entities,
pension funds and investors that hold our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or conversion transaction are among those
categories of potential investors that are subject to special rules not covered in this discussion. This summary does not address
any U.S. federal gift tax consequences, or state or local or non-U.S. tax consequences. This summary does not provide a complete
analysis of all potential tax considerations. The information provided below is based

123

Table of Contents

on existing authorities. These authorities may change, or the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, might interpret the existing
authorities differently. In either case, the tax considerations of owning or disposing of common stock could differ from those
described below.

        INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX LAWS TO THEIR
PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF OTHER U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL OR NON-U.S.
LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATIES.

Dividends

        Payments of cash and other property that we make to our shareholders with respect to our common stock will constitute
dividends to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and proﬁts, as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles. To the extent those dividends exceed our current and accumulated earnings and proﬁts, the dividends will constitute a
return of capital and will ﬁrst reduce a holder's basis, but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the sale of stock.

        The gross amount of any dividend (out of earnings and proﬁts) paid to a non-U.S. holder of common stock generally will be
subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless the holder is entitled to an exemption from or reduced rate of withholding
under an applicable income tax treaty. In order to receive an exemption or a reduced treaty rate, prior to the payment of a
dividend, a non-U.S. holder must provide us with an IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form) certifying qualiﬁcation for the
exemption or reduced rate.

        Dividends received by a non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the non-
U.S. holder (and dividends attributable to a non-U.S. holder's permanent establishment in the U.S. if an income tax treaty applies)
are exempt from this withholding tax. To obtain this exemption, prior to the payment of a dividend, a non-U.S. holder must
provide us with an IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) properly certifying this exemption. Effectively connected dividends (or
dividends attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S. if an income tax treaty applies), although not subject to
withholding tax, are taxed at the same graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons, net of certain deductions and credits. In
addition, dividends received by a corporate non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the
corporate non-U.S. holder (or dividends attributable to a corporate non-U.S. holder's permanent establishment in the U.S. if an
income tax treaty applies) may also be subject to a branch proﬁts tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be speciﬁed by
an applicable income tax treaty).

        A non-U.S. holder who provides us with an IRS Form W-8BEN or an IRS Form W-8ECI will be required to periodically
update such form.

        A non-U.S. holder of common stock that is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty
may obtain a refund of any excess amounts currently withheld if an appropriate claim for refund is timely ﬁled with the IRS.

124

Table of Contents

Gain on Disposition of Common Stock

        A non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gains realized on the sale, exchange or
other disposition of common stock unless:

•

•

•

the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the non-U.S. holder (or attributable to a
permanent establishment in the U.S. if an income tax treaty applies), in which case the non-U.S. holder generally
will be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale under regular graduated U.S. federal income tax
rates and, if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation, the branch proﬁts tax may apply, at a 30% rate or such lower rate
as may be speciﬁed by an applicable income tax treaty; 

the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or
more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met, in
which case the non-U.S. holder will be required to pay a ﬂat 30% tax (or such lower rate as may be speciﬁed by
an applicable income tax treaty between the U.S. and such non-U.S. holder's country of residence) on the net gain
derived from the disposition, which tax may be offset by U.S. source capital losses, if any, provided that the non-
U.S. holder has timely ﬁled U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses; or 

our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of our status as a "U.S. real property holding
corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the ﬁve-year period preceding
the disposition or the holder's holding period for our common stock. We believe that we are not currently, and we
are not likely to become, a "U.S. real property holding corporation" for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        If we become a U.S. real property holding corporation after this offering, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on
an established securities market and continues to be so traded, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
gain recognized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of our common stock as a result of such status unless
(i) such holder actually or constructively owned more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of (A) the
ﬁve-year period preceding the disposition, or (B) the holder's holding period for our common stock, and (ii) we were a U.S. real
property holding corporation at any time during such period when the more than 5% ownership test was met. If any gain on your
disposition is taxable because we are a U.S. real property holding corporation and your ownership of our common stock exceeds
5%, you will be taxed on such disposition generally in the manner applicable to U.S. persons. Any such non-U.S. holder that
owns or has owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% of our common stock is urged to consult that holder's own tax
advisor with respect to the particular tax consequences to such holder for the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of
shares of our common stock if we were to be or to become a U.S. real property holding corporation.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

        Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid, the name and address of the recipient, and the
amount, if any, of tax withheld. A similar report is sent to the recipient. Pursuant to tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may
make its reports available to tax authorities in the non-U.S. holder's country of residence.

125

Table of Contents

        Payments of dividends or of proceeds on the disposition of stock made to a non-U.S. holder may be subject to additional
information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply if the non-U.S. holder establishes an
exemption, for example, by properly certifying its non-U.S. person status on an IRS Form W-8BEN (or successor form).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason
to know, that the holder is a U.S. person.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a credit or refund
may be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

Legislation Relating to Foreign Accounts

        Under legislation enacted in 2010, a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will be imposed on dividends on stock of U.S.
corporations, and on the gross proceeds from the disposition of such stock, paid to a "foreign ﬁnancial institution" (as specially
deﬁned for this purpose), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and provide to the
U.S. Treasury substantial information regarding its U.S. account holders and certain account holders that are foreign entities with
U.S. owners. A 30% U.S. federal withholding tax will also apply to dividends paid on stock of U.S. corporations and on the gross
proceeds from the disposition of such stock paid to a non-ﬁnancial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding
agent with a certiﬁcation that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certiﬁcation identifying the direct and indirect
substantial U.S. owners of the entity. The withholding taxes described above generally will apply to dividend payments made
after December 31, 2013 and payments of gross proceeds made after December 31, 2016. Under certain circumstances, a non-
U.S. holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such withholding taxes. Investors are urged to consult with their own tax
advisors regarding the possible application of these rules to their investment in our common stock.

U.S. Federal Estate Tax

        The estates of nonresident alien individuals are generally subject to U.S. federal estate tax on property with a U.S. situs.
Because we are a U.S. corporation, our common stock will be U.S. situs property and therefore will be included in the taxable
estate of a nonresident alien decedent. The U.S. federal estate tax liability of the estate of a nonresident alien may be affected by a
tax treaty between the U.S. and the decedent's country of residence.

UNDERWRITING 

        Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Piper Jaffray & Co. are acting as representatives of each of the underwriters named
below. Subject to the conditions set forth in an underwriting agreement among us, the selling stockholders and the underwriters,
we have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each of the underwriters has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us
the number of shares of our common stock set forth opposite its name below:

Piper Jaffray & Co. 
Cowen and Company, LLC

Total:

        The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares from us and subject to
prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of
the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to
certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of common stock offered by this
prospectus if any such shares are taken. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the
underwriters' over-allotment option described below. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults,
the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the offering may be terminated.

        The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of common stock directly to the public at the offering price
listed on the cover page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of $         per
share. After the initial public offering of the shares of common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may be changed
by the underwriters. Sales of shares made outside of the U.S. may be made by afﬁliates of the underwriters.

Option to Purchase Additional Shares of Common Stock

        We have granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to
405,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less
underwriting discounts and commissions. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject
to certain conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage of the additional shares of common stock as the number
listed next to the underwriter's name in the preceding table bears to the total number of shares of common stock listed next to the
names of all underwriters in the preceding table. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering
over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus.

outstanding stock and stock options (including the selling stockholders) entered into and are subject to lock-up agreements which
will terminate on March 25, 2014. The terms of such lock-up agreements are substantially similar to the terms of the lock-up
agreements entered into in connection with this offering, as described below.

stockholders have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, without the prior written consent of Raymond James and Piper

ﬁle or cause to be ﬁled any registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the

common stock (other than any registration statement on Form S-8).

        The preceding restrictions apply without regard to whether any such transaction described above is to be settled by delivery
of common stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise. In addition, we and each such person agree that, without the prior
written consent of the representatives, we and each such person will not, during the period ending 90 days after the date of this
prospectus, make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of common stock or any
security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock.

        The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to:

•

•

•

the sale of shares to the underwriters pursuant to the underwriting agreement; 

the grant or exercise of options pursuant to our existing stock option plans; 

transfers of shares of common stock or any security convertible into common stock as a bona ﬁde gift; 

transfers of shares of common stock or any security convertible into common stock by will or intestate succession
or to any trust for the direct or indirect beneﬁt of the stockholder or immediate family of the stockholder; or 

the establishment of a trading plan designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act for the
transfer of shares of common stock;

provided that in the case of any transfer or distribution as described in the second, third or fourth bullet points above, (i) each
recipient or transferee agrees to be subject to the restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and (ii) no public
announcement or ﬁling under the Exchange Act with respect to such transfer shall be required or voluntarily made during the

restricted period referred to above).

        The 90 day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be extended if, during any period that we are not an

Stabilization

        Until this offering is completed, rules of the SEC may limit the ability of the underwriters and various selling group
members to bid for and purchase the shares of our common stock. As an exception to these rules and in accordance with
Regulation M under the Exchange Act, the underwriters may engage in activities that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the
price of our common stock in order to facilitate the offering of the common stock, including: short sales; syndicate covering
transactions; imposition of penalty bids; and purchases to cover positions created by short sales.

        Stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of shares of our common stock, which involve the sale by the
underwriters of a greater number of shares than it is required to purchase in this offering and purchasing shares of common stock
from us by exercising the over-allotment option or in the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may
be "covered" shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters' over-allotment option referred to
above, or may be "naked" shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount.

        Each underwriter may close out any covered short position either by exercising its over-allotment option, in whole or in part,
or by purchasing shares of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed. In making this
determination, each underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of shares of our common stock available for
purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriter may purchase shares of our common stock pursuant
to the over-allotment option.

        A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure
on the price of shares of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchased
in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares of our common stock
in the open market to cover the position after the pricing of this offering.

        The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid on selling group members. This means that if the underwriters purchase
shares of our common stock in the open market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the underwriters can require the
selling group members that sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the selling concession received by them.

        As a result of these activities, the price of shares of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might
exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them without notice at any time.
The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise.

        The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.

Relationships

        Certain of the underwriters and their afﬁliates may provide from time to time in the future certain commercial banking,
ﬁnancial advisory, investment banking and other services for us and such afﬁliates, and for the selling stockholders and their
afﬁliates, in the ordinary course of their business, for which they will receive customary fees and commissions, as applicable, and
reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, from time to time, certain of the underwriters and their afﬁliates may
effect transactions for their own account or the account of

130

Table of Contents

customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity securities or loans,
and may do so in the future.

Listing

        Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "AAOI."

Electronic Prospectus

        A prospectus in electronic format may be available on the Internet sites or through other online services maintained by one
or more of the underwriters and selling group members participating in this offering, or by their afﬁliates. In those cases,
prospective investors may view offering terms online and, depending upon the underwriter or the selling group member,
prospective investors may be allowed to place orders online. The underwriters may agree with us to allocate a speciﬁc number of
shares of common stock for sale to online brokerage account holders. Any such allocation for online distributions will be made
by the underwriters on the same basis as other allocations.

        Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on any underwriter's or any selling group member's website
and any information contained in any other website maintained by the underwriters or any selling group member is not part of
this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, has not been approved or endorsed by us or
any underwriters or any selling group member in its capacity as underwriter or selling group member and should not be relied
upon by investors.

Selling Restrictions

        Other than in the U.S. and as described below, no action has been taken by us or the underwriters that would permit a public
offering of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.

and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose possession this prospectus comes are advised to inform themselves about
and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This prospectus does not constitute
an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of common stock offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction in
which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

subject to obtaining the prior consent of the book-running managers for any such offer; or 

at any time in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by us of a prospectus pursuant to
Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

        For the purposes of the above, the expression "offer of securities to the public" in relation to any securities in any Member
State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufﬁcient information on the terms of the offer and the
securities to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the securities, as the same may be varied

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.:

        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (a Delaware corporation)
and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2013. These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these ﬁnancial statements based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial
statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial
position of Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations
and their cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE A—ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS

        Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. ("AOI" or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Texas on February 28, 1997. The
Company is a leading, vertically integrated provider of ﬁber-optic networking products, primarily for three networking end-
markets: cable television, ﬁber-to-the-home and internet data centers. The Company designs and manufactures a range of optical
communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key
equipment.

        Prime World International Holdings, Ltd. ("Prime World") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in the
British Virgin Islands on January 13, 2006. Prime World is the parent company of Global Technology, Inc. ("Global"). Global
was established in June 2002 in the People's Republic of China ("PRC") and was acquired by Prime World on March 30, 2006.
The Company also operates a division, AOI—Taiwan, which is qualiﬁed to do business in Taiwan and primarily manufactures
transceivers and performs research and development activities.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

1.     Basis of Presentation

        The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

2.     Use of Estimates

        The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and
accompanying notes. Signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions that impact these ﬁnancial statements relate to, among other things,
allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserve, share-based compensation expense, estimated useful lives of property and
equipment, and taxes.

3.     Foreign Currency Translation

        All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet
date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at weighted-average rates for the reporting period. Translation adjustments do
not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations.

4.     Fair Value

        The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and note
receivable approximate their historical fair values due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of the debt approximates
its fair value due to the

F-8

Table of Contents

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

short-term nature of the debt since it renews frequently at current interest rates. Management believes that the interest rates in
effect at each year end represent the current market rates for similar borrowings.

5.     Cash and Cash Equivalents

        The Company considers all highly liquid securities with an original maturity of ninety days or less from the date of purchase
to be cash equivalents. Cash in foreign accounts was approximately $6.6 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively.

        The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents at U.S. ﬁnancial institutions for which the combined account balances in
individual institutions may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance coverage and, as a result, there is a
concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2013,
approximately $16.0 million of U.S. deposits were not covered by FDIC insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses
and believes it is not exposed to any signiﬁcant risk with such accounts.

6.     Restricted Cash/Compensating Balances

        The Company is required to maintain a compensation deposit equal to 30% of its bank acceptance notes to vendors with a
China bank. The Company's Taiwan subsidiary also uses time deposits for customs guarantee. As of December 31, 2013 and
2012, the amount of restricted cash was $0.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

7.     Short-Term Investments

        The Company invests its excess cash in bank certiﬁcates of deposit. As of December 31, 2013, the Company invested
$8.0 million in certiﬁcates of deposit in RMB currencies with Taiwan banks. The maturity dates range from 6 months to
12 months.

        The Company arranged a revolving line of credit agreement with the same Taiwan bank by pledging 100% of its certiﬁcates
of deposit. As of December 31, 2013, the pledged certiﬁcate of deposit for such arrangement amount is $4.0 million.

8.     Accounts Receivable/Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

        The Company carries its accounts receivable at the net amount that it estimates to be collectible. An allowance for
uncollectable accounts is maintained through a charge against operations. The allowance is determined by management review of
outstanding amounts per customer, historical payments and the aging of accounts.

F-9

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

9.     Bank Acceptance Receivable

        The Company carries its bank acceptance receivables at face value or discounted value if they are not interest bearing. The
maturity date of the receivables are all within one year of the original issuance date and are carried at face value.

10.  Concentration of Credit Risk and Signiﬁcant Customers

        Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash, cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. The Company places all cash and cash equivalents with high-credit quality ﬁnancial institutions.

        The Company performs ongoing credit valuations of its customers' ﬁnancial condition whenever deemed necessary and
generally does not require deposits or collateral to support customer receivables. The historical amount of losses on uncollectible
accounts has been within the Company's estimates. The Company generates much of its revenue from a limited number of
customers. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, its top ten customers represented 76.9%, 77.6% and 76.6% of its revenue, respectively. In
2013, Cisco Systems, Inc. represented 21.8% of its revenue, Amazon represented 18.2% of its revenue and Biogenomics Corp., a
distributor, represented 8.7% of its total revenue. The ﬁve largest receivable balances for customers represented an aggregate of
66%, and 58% of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

11.  Fair Value Accounting

        The fair value measurement standard deﬁnes fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The standard characterizes inputs used
in determining fair value according to a hierarchy that prioritized inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

        Level 1—Inputs represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

        Level 2—Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

        Level 3—Inputs that are not observable from objective sources, such as management's internally developed
assumptions used in pricing an asset or liability.

        Assets and liabilities that are required to be fair valued on a recurring basis include money market funds, marketable
securities, equity instruments and contingent consideration.

F-10

Table of Contents

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

        Money market funds are valued with Level 1 inputs, using quoted market prices, and are included in cash and cash
equivalents on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

12.  Inventories

        Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average-cost method) or market. Work in process and ﬁnished goods includes
materials, labor and allocated overhead. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventory on a periodic basis and provides
write-offs for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future demand.

13.  Property, Plant and Equipment

        Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company calculates
depreciation using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Useful lives

Buildings
Land improvements
Machinery and equipment  3 - 20 years
Furniture and ﬁxtures
  1 - 8 years
Computer equipment and

  20 - 40 years
  10 years

software

3 - 7 years

Leasehold improvements   The shorter of the life of the applicable lease or the useful life

Transportation equipment   5 years

of the improvement

        Major improvements are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Construction in
progress represents property, plant and equipment under construction or being installed. Costs include original cost, installation,
construction and other direct costs which include interest on borrowings used to ﬁnance the asset. Construction in progress is
transferred to the appropriate ﬁxed asset account and depreciation commences when the asset has been substantially completed
and placed in service.

        Land use rights allow the Company rights for 50 years to certain land in Ningbo, China on which the Company built a
facility that included ofﬁce space, manufacturing operations and employee dormitories. The land use rights are recorded at cost
and are amortized on the straight-line basis over the useful life of the related contract. The land use rights expire on October 7,
2054.

14.  Intangible Assets

        Intangible assets consist of intellectual property that is stated at cost less accumulated amortization. As of December 31,
2013, the Company had 113 total patents issued. The costs

F-11

 
 
 
Table of Contents

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

incurred to obtain such patents have been capitalized and are being amortized over an estimated life of 20 years. The Company
periodically evaluates its intangible assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that a patent or
trademark may not be applicable to the Company's current products or is no longer in use. If such a determination is made, the
intangible asset is impaired and the remaining value of the patent or trademark will be expensed at that time.

15.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

        The Company accounts for impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation ("ASC")
360, Property, Plant and Equipment, ("ASC 360"). Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment. In
accordance with ASC 360, the Company periodically evaluates long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When triggering event indicators are present, the Company
obtains appraisals on an asset by asset basis, and will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the appraised values is less
than the carrying amounts of such assets. The appraised values, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and
projections, require subjective judgments. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the appraised values projected in
the evaluation of long-lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes. The appraisals consider the likelihood of possible
outcomes in determining the best estimate for the value of the assets.

        The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the appraisals.

16.  Comprehensive Income

        ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, ("ASC 220") establishes rules for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components. ASC 220 requires that unrealized gains and losses on the Company's foreign currency translation adjustments be
included in comprehensive income.

17.  Share-based Compensation

        The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation—Stock
Compensation. Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on the estimated grant date fair value, net of an estimated
forfeiture rate, in order to recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest. Compensation cost is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options.

18.  Revenue Recognition

        The Company derives revenue from the manufacture and sale of ﬁber-optic networking products. Revenue recognition
follows the criteria of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Speciﬁcally, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence
exists of an arrangement with a customer, usually in the form of a customer purchase order; delivery to a

third party carrier has occurred; title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer; the price is ﬁxed or determinable;
collectability is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance. The Company may offer
units (samples) to current and potential customers at no charge for evaluation or qualiﬁcation purposes. Such sample units are
expensed as selling or research and development costs when shipped.

19.  Advertising Costs

        Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred and amounted to approximately $121,000, $80,000 and $104,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

20.  Research and Development

        Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. The Company receives reimbursement for certain
development costs, which are capitalized when incurred, up to the reimbursable amount.

21.  Income Taxes

        The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes. The liability method
is used to account for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The realizability of deferred tax
assets are evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to
future beneﬁts in the Company's tax returns.

        Uncertain tax provisions are recorded at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount of tax, interest and penalties
that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement with the tax authorities in the domestic and
international jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company records tax-related interest and penalties as a
component of income tax expense.

22.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information

        During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, $0.8 million and $1.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the
convertible shareholder notes was converted by the holders, respectively. Upon conversion, 72,381 shares and 60,556 shares of
Series G Preferred Stock were issued to the holders, respectively.

23.  New Accounting Standards Adopted in this Report

        ASU 2011-04.    In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to
Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This ASU represents the
converged guidance of the FASB and the IASB on measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value

measurements. The amendments in this ASU clarify the board of directors' intent about the application of existing fair value
measurement and disclosure requirements and changes particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value and for
disclosing information about fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2011-04 on January 1, 2012, and the
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.

24.  Reverse Stock Split

        On May 1, 2013, the Company's board of directors approved, and holders of the requisite number of outstanding shares of
our capital stock approved on May 21, 2013, an amendment to our certiﬁcate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split with
respect to our securities. Based on the prior board and stockholder approvals, on August 16, 2013 the Company's board of
directors determined that the ratio for the reverse stock split would be 30-to-one. The reverse stock split was effected on
August 20, 2013, the date that the amendment to our certiﬁcate of incorporation was ﬁled with the Delaware Secretary of State.
The reverse stock split is reﬂected in the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements and related notes on a retroactive basis
for all periods presented.

NOTE C—EARNINGS PER SHARE

        Basic net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
and dilutive potential common shares from options, restricted stock units and warrants outstanding during the period. In periods
with net losses, normally dilutive shares become anti-dilutive. Therefore, basic and dilutive earnings per share are the same.

        The U.S. bank loans and line of credit agreement require the Company to meet certain ﬁnancial covenants including a
minimum current ratio, debt service coverage, unrestricted cash and maximum debt over tangible net worth ratio requirements.
Collateral for the U.S. bank loans and line of credit includes substantially all of the assets of the Company. As of December 31,
2013, the Company was in compliance with all of its ﬁnancial and operational covenants associated with these loans.

        As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $9.1 million of unused borrowing capacity.

        In December 2013, the Company renewed its U.S. revolving line of credit of $7.0 million with the same U.S. bank with a
maturity date of November 15, 2015. The interest rate on this line of credit is the prime rate plus 0.50% or the ﬂoor rate 3.75%,
whichever is higher.

        The Company issued warrants to the same U.S. bank in connection with the renewals of the loan in 2009, 2010 and 2012.
The Company estimated the fair value of these warrants at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and
records the expense over the life of the warrants. As of December 31, 2013, 32,665 warrants related to these loans are
outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, $16,000 remains to be expensed for these warrants and this expense is expected to be
recognized over the next four years.

        The Company, through its China subsidiary, established RMB and USD currency lines of credit for $12.1 million and
$3.3 million with a China Bank as of December 31, 2013. The interest rate for the RMB line of credit ranged from 108% and
110% of the China prime rate. The interest rate for USD currency ranged from 4.1% to 4.2%.This credit line is a revolving line
that is renewable by its anniversary. Collateral for the loans includes the land use rights, building and equipment located in China.

        The Company extended its equipment ﬁnancing agreement of $1.0 million with a Taiwan bank in 2013. The ﬁnancing
agreement required equipment collateral. The agreement requires monthly installment payments over 24 months and ends in July
2015. The ﬁnancing agreement bears interest at the rate of 4.95%.

        The Company, through its Taiwan branch, established a $8.0 million revolving line of credit with Taiwan banks in 2013. The
ﬁnancing agreement required collateral of its time deposit of $8.0 million that is included in short-term investments. The interest
rate for the revolving line of credit is variable every six months at Taiwan Time Deposit Interest Rate Index plus 0.41% maturing
in December 2014, which is 1.78% as of December 31, 2013.

NOTE I—SHORT-TERM LOAN WITH SHAREHOLDERS

        In 2010, the Company borrowed $3.2 million from 12 shareholders under the terms of unsecured promissory note
agreements. These notes bore an interest rate of 6% with maturity dates of 18 months from the effective dates of the notes
originally maturing on October 21, 2011, but extended to December 31, 2012. The note holders were also issued warrants that
expire by April 23, 2020, to purchase 51,200 shares of the Company's Series F Preferred Stock, with an exercise price of $7.50
per share. As part of the loan maturity date extension, additional warrants to purchase 6,081 shares of the Company's Series G
Preferred Stock were issued in 2011 with an exercise price of $18.00 per share that expire on April 23, 2020.

        In 2011, two of the note holders converted their respective notes into shares of Series G Preferred Stock and four of the
notes were repaid in full. In 2012, ﬁve of the remaining note holders converted their respective notes into shares of Series G
Preferred Stock and one of the notes was repaid. As of December 31, 2012, all principal and interest related to these notes had
been fully satisﬁed.

        During the year ended December 31, 2013, warrants related to these loans were exercised for 64,219 shares of common
stock.

NOTE L—INCOME TAXES (Continued)

        The valuation allowance was established to reduce the deferred tax asset for the amounts that will likely not be realized.
This reduction is primarily necessary due to the uncertainty of the Company's ability to utilize all of the net operating loss carry
forwards. The valuation allowance decreased by $7.5 million in 2013 and increased by approximately $1.5 million and
$0.8 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

        The Company has a U.S. net operating loss carry forward of approximately $65.7 million, which expires between 2024 and
2033. The Company also has U.S. research and development tax credits of $1.6 million which expire between 2020 and 2032.
The Company has a net operating loss carryforward from its China operations of approximately $3.6 million, which expires
between 2014 and 2018. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a substantial annual
limitation due to the ownership change limitations set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Based upon analysis
performed with respect to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, approximately $21.7 million of the total available U.S. net
operating loss carry forwards will not be available for utilization as an offset to taxable income in future periods. Because of
changes in control that are deemed to have occurred under Section 382, the Company's net operating loss carry forward available
in calendar year 2013 to shelter taxable income was limited to $41.3 million at December 31, 2013, with an additional
$3.7 million becoming available between 2014 and 2025. The additional $3.7 million is subject to an annual limitation of the
$0.3 million. Additional ownership changes could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward
before utilization.

        The Company ﬁles income tax returns in the U.S federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. As of
December 31, 2013, the Company's federal returns for the year ended December 31, 2011 through the current period are still
open to examination. In addition, all of the net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards that may be
utilized in future years are still subject to examination. The Company is not currently subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or
non-U.S. income tax examinations by any tax authorities.

        A reconciliation of the U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 to the
Company's effective income tax rate follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE L—INCOME TAXES (Continued)

        The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Global Technology, Inc., has enjoyed preferential tax concessions in China as a
national high-tech enterprise. In March 2007, China's parliament enacted the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law,
under which, effective January 1, 2008, China adopted a uniform income tax rate of 25% for all enterprises including foreign
invested enterprises. Global Technology, Inc. was recognized as a national high-tech enterprise in 2008 and was entitled to a 15%
tax rate for a three year period from November 2008 to November 2011. In 2011, Global Technology, Inc. renewed its national
high-tech enterprise certiﬁcate and was therefore extended its three year tax preferential status from November 2011 to
November 2014.

        For 2011 and 2012, there were no identiﬁed uncertain tax positions. During 2013, the Company's liabilities for uncertain tax
positions increased by $2.2 million based on tax positions related to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards. As of
December 31, 2013, we had $2.2 million, of unrecognized tax beneﬁts on net operating loss carryforwards that must be certiﬁed
under the dual consolidated loss rules. If recognized, there would be no impact the Company's effective tax rate as a result of the
full valuation allowance previously recognized. We believe that it is reasonably possible that $0 of our remaining unrecognized
tax positions may be recognized by the end of 2014 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.

NOTE M—SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

        The Company's board of directors and stockholders previously approved the 1998 Share Incentive Plan, the 2000 Share
Incentive Plan, the 2004 Share Incentive Plan and the 2006 Share Incentive Plan (collectively the "Prior Plans"). As of
December 31, 2013, the Company had options outstanding to purchase 708,473 shares of common stock under its Prior Plans
with a weighted average exercise price of $6.68 per share. Following the Company's initial public offering in September 2013, no
further awards will be granted under the Prior Plans. However, all outstanding awards under the Prior Plans will continue to exist
and will continue to be governed by their existing terms.

        On April 12, 2013, our board of directors adopted and approved the Company's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, (the "2013
Plan"), and it was subsequently approved by the Company's stockholders on May 21, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the
Company had options outstanding to purchase 759,429 shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan with a weighted average
exercise price of $9.97 per share.

        The Company issues stock options to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Stock option awards for the Prior
Plans and the 2013 Plan generally vest over a four year period and have a maximum term of ten years. Stock options under these
plans have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant. Nonqualiﬁed and Incentive
Stock Options and restrictive stock units ("RSUs") may be granted from these plans. Prior to the Company's initial public
offering, the fair market value of the Company's stock had been historically determined by the board of directors and from time to
time with the assistance of third party valuation specialists.

NOTE M—SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

        Under the 2013 Plan, participants may be granted RSUs, representing an unfunded, unsecured right to receive common
stock on the date speciﬁed in the recipient's award. The RSUs granted under the plan generally vest over one year at a rate of
1/12th per month. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting term of the
award.

        During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company granted 33,000 RSUs with a total grant-date fair value of
$0.3 million. The resulting compensation expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately
$0.2 million. At December 31, 2013, there was $0.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, all of which is
expected to be realized within one year.

        The Company estimates the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following assumptions:

Expected volatility
Risk-free interest rate
Expected term (years)
Expected dividend yield
Estimated forfeitures

        As there had been no market for the Company's common stock prior to its initial public offering, the expected volatility for
options granted to date was derived from an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with
similar terms. The expected volatility has been determined using an average of the expected volatility reported by this peer group
of companies. The Company uses a risk free interest rate based on the 10-year Treasury as reported during the period. The
expected term of the options has been determined utilizing the simpliﬁed method which calculates a simple average based on
vesting period and option life. The Company does not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. Estimated forfeitures are
based on historical experience and future work force projections.

Item 14.    Indemniﬁcation of Directors and Ofﬁcers 

        Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") authorizes a corporation to indemnify its directors and
ofﬁcers against liabilities arising out of actions, suits and proceedings to which they are made or threatened to be made a party by
reason of the fact that they have served or are currently serving as a director or ofﬁcer to a corporation. The indemnity may cover
expenses (including attorneys' fees) judgments, ﬁnes and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the
director or ofﬁcer in connection with any such action, suit or proceeding. Section 145 permits corporations to pay expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred by directors and ofﬁcers in advance of the ﬁnal disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.
In addition, Section 145 provides that a corporation has the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of its directors
and ofﬁcers against any liability asserted against them and incurred by them in their capacity as a director or ofﬁcer, or arising out
of their status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the director or ofﬁcer against such
liability under Section 145.

        Provisions in our amended and restated certiﬁcate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws limit or eliminate the
personal liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now exists or may in the future be amended.
Consequently, a director will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages or breach of ﬁduciary duty
as a director, except for liability for:

•

•

•

any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; 

any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; 

any unlawful payments related to dividends or unlawful stock purchases, redemptions or other distributions; or

Table of Contents

•

any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal beneﬁt.

        These limitations of liability do not alter director liability under the federal securities laws and do not affect the availability
of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission.

        In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that:

•

•

we will indemnify our directors, ofﬁcers and, in the discretion of our board of directors, certain employees to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as it now exists or may in the future be amended; and 

we will advance reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to our directors and, in the discretion of our board
of directors, to our ofﬁcers and certain employees, in connection with legal proceedings relating to their service
for or on behalf of us, subject to limited exceptions.

        We have entered into indemniﬁcation agreements with each of our directors and certain of our executive ofﬁcers. These
agreements provide that we will indemnify each of our directors and certain of our executive ofﬁcers to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law.

        We also maintain general liability insurance which covers certain liabilities of our directors and ofﬁcers arising out of claims
based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or ofﬁcers, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

Item 15.    Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 

        In the three completed ﬁscal years preceding the ﬁling of this registration statement, we have issued the following securities
that were not registered under the Securities Act:

(a)    Issuances of Capital Stock.

        On December 31, 2011, we issued and sold an aggregate of 222,554 shares of Series G preferred stock to twenty-ﬁve
investors, at a price of $18.00 per share, in the initial closing of our Series G private placement. Between May 25, 2012 and
September 7, 2012, we issued and sold an additional 1,046,999 shares of Series G preferred stock to ﬁfty-four investors, at a price
of $10.50 per share, in the second closing of our Series G private placement. As a result of the second closing of our Series G
private placement, we agreed to amend the per share price of the initial closing of our Series G private placement from $18.00 per
share to $10.50 per share and, as a result an additional 158,973 shares of Series G preferred stock was issued to the investors of
the initial closing of our Series G private placement. As a result, a total of 1,428,526 shares of Series G preferred stock was
issued by our company. Of the total proceeds received under our Series G private placement, $4.2 million was recorded (of which
$3.0 million was booked as a receivable) during the six-month period ending June 30, 2012, and the $3.0 million receivable was
collected and the remaining proceeds from the private placement were received during the second half of 2012.

        No underwriters were used in the foregoing transactions. All sales of securities described above were made in reliance upon
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act (and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder) of
the Securities Act for transactions by a registrant not involving a public offering. All of the foregoing securities are deemed
restricted securities for the purposes of the Securities Act.

II-2

Table of Contents

        Upon the completion of our initial public offering, each share of redeemable Series A preferred stock converted into
approximately 3.1731 shares of common stock, each share of Series C preferred stock converted into approximately
2.3107 shares of common stock, each share of Series D preferred stock converted into approximately 2.5360 shares of common
stock, each share of Series E preferred stock converted into approximately 3.6186 shares of common stock, each share of Series F
preferred stock converted into approximately 1.2000 shares of common stock, and each share of Series G preferred stock
converted into 1.0000 share of common stock.

(b)    Grants and Exercises of Stock Options and RSUs

        From January 1, 2010 to the ﬁling of our registration statement on Form S-8 on November 19, 2013 ("Form S-8"), we
granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of 1,311,327 shares of common stock with exercise prices ranging from $6.00 to
$13.13 per share, to employees, ofﬁcers, directors and consultants pursuant to our stock option plans. Options to purchase
18,053 shares of common stock have been exercised for consideration aggregating $108,042.00 from January 1, 2010 to the ﬁling
of our Form S-8. From January 1, 2010 to the ﬁling of our Form S-8, we granted 33,000 restricted stock units to directors
pursuant to our stock option plans. The issuance of common stock upon exercise of the options and the RSU grants were exempt
either pursuant to Rule 701, as a transaction pursuant to a compensatory beneﬁt plan, or pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act or Regulation S of the Securities Act, as a transaction by a registrant not involving a public offering. The shares of common
stock issued upon exercise of options and the RSU grants are deemed restricted securities for the purposes of the Securities Act.

(c)    Issuances and Exercises of Warrants

        On November 2, 2012, we issued warrants to our U.S. lender to purchase 6,667 shares of Series G preferred stock, with an
exercise price of $10.50 per share and an expiration date equal to thirty days after the expiration of the initial lock-up period
agreed to between our company and its underwriters in connection with our initial public offering. As of the ﬁling of this
registration statement, none of the warrants described above have been exercised.

        On May 17, 2011, we issued warrants to Alliance Management Consulting Co. Ltd. to purchase 10,000 shares of our
common stock in partial consideration of certain services provided to us. The exercise price of the warrants is $6.00 per share and
expired upon the closing of our initial public offering. Prior to such expiration, warrants were exercised for 10,000 shares of
common stock.

        On December 31, 2011, we issued warrants to purchase 33,385 shares of Series G preferred stock, with an exercise price of
$18.00 per share in connection with the initial closing of our Series G private placement, to the investors of the initial closing of
our Series G private placement. However, the warrants were terminated as a result of the second closing of our Series G private
placement in which we agreed to amend the per share price of the initial closing of our Series G Private Placement from $18.00
per share to $10.50 per share. As of the ﬁling of this registration statement, none of the warrants described above have been
exercised.

        On December 31, 2011, we issued warrants to eight individuals and entities to purchase 6,081 shares of Series G preferred
stock in connection with eight promissory notes we entered into with such individuals and entities. The exercise price of the
warrants is $18.00 per share and expired upon the closing of our initial public offering. Prior to such expiration, warrants were
exercised for 2,778 shares of Series G preferred stock.

        No underwriters were used in the foregoing transactions. All sales of securities described above were made in reliance upon
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act (and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder) of
the Securities Act for transactions by a registrant not involving a public offering. All of the foregoing securities are deemed

Item 16.    Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules 

(a)    Exhibits

        See the Exhibit Index on the page immediately following the signature page for a list of exhibits ﬁled as part of this
registration statement on Form S-1, which Exhibit Index is incorporated herein by reference.

(b)    Financial Statement Schedules

        Schedules not listed above have been omitted because the information required to be set forth therein is not applicable or is
shown in the ﬁnancial statements or notes thereto.

Item 17.    Undertakings 

        The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing speciﬁed in the underwriting
agreements certiﬁcates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt
delivery to each purchaser.

        Insofar as indemniﬁcation for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, ofﬁcers and
controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 14 of this registration statement, or otherwise,
the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemniﬁcation is against
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemniﬁcation
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, ofﬁcer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, ofﬁcer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemniﬁcation by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the ﬁnal adjudication of
such issue.

        The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:

        (1)   For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the
form of prospectus ﬁled as part of this Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of
prospectus ﬁled by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to
be part of this Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective.

        (2)   For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment
that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona ﬁde offering thereof.
